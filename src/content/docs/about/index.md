## Purpose

The TSA Writing Library is a digital archive dedicated to preserving and making accessible the written heritage of The Salvation Army. Beginning with the works of Founder William Booth, this library gathers sermons, articles, book chapters, letters, and other writings that shaped the movement and continue to inspire Salvationists today.

## What You'll Find

This library currently features over 100 works by William Booth, including:

- **In Darkest England and the Way Out** — his landmark book on poverty and social reform
- **The Founder's Messages to Soldiers** — 35 spiritual messages to the rank and file
- **How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel** — early Christian Mission reports
- **Fishing for Men** and **How to Preach** — practical ministry training series
- **Dozens of short articles** on holiness, leadership, evangelism, women's ministry, and more

## Growing Collection

This is a living archive. The collection will continue to grow with:

- Additional works by William Booth (over 200 more in preparation)
- Writings by other historic Salvation Army leaders
- Selected contemporary articles from Salvation Army publications
- New contributions from current Salvation Army writers and thinkers

## About the Project

The writings in this library have been carefully transcribed from historical PDFs and source documents into a structured, searchable digital format. Each work is tagged with metadata — author, date, series, type, and topics — to make browsing and discovery as easy as possible.

This project is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build), and the source content is maintained as open markdown files.

## Contributing

If you have Salvation Army writings you'd like to see included in this library, or if you spot errors in any of the transcriptions, please reach out. This is a community resource, and contributions are welcome.
