**Salvation Army Officer & Author**

Major Frank Duracher is a Salvation Army officer whose career included multiple appointments in journalism and publications, including service at the Army's National Headquarters. Inspired by Paul Harvey's storytelling style, he compiled "Now You Know: The Rest of The Army's Story" — a collection of 50 remarkable, often forgotten anecdotes from The Salvation Army's history and contemporary ministry, drawn from over 20 years of writing for publications including the War Cry, Southern Spirit, and Young Salvationist.
