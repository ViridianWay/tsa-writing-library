# The General's Christmas Message: The Light Shines in the Darkness

As a young boy, I suffered from chronic bronchial asthma. Often, asthma attacks would come in the dark of the night. The result: fear of the dark, panic, and, as I recall, a sense of desperation as I struggled to catch my next breath. Cue Mum to the rescue: calming, reassuring, helping, embracing.

“Mum, can you leave the light on?” I would ask. The hallway light was left on; my door was pulled nearly shut. The light, shining through the crack in the door, signified so much to me: I could see, the dark was not nearly as oppressive, and the light represented the reality of my mother’s presence. It calmed, reassured, reminded, and, most of all, it dispelled the darkness and my fear. The light has come!

Over the centuries, light and dark have been used by cultures and religions to differentiate between good and evil, pure and impure, right and wrong, life and death. Light overcomes the darkness, good triumphs over evil, right prevails over wrong, hope wins over hopelessness. “Mum, can you leave the light on?”

Light and dark is a recurring theme in scripture from the very beginning. Early in the first book of the Bible, these memorable words are noted: *“Then God said, ‘Let there be light,’”* (Genesis 1:3).

The prophet Isaiah, writing at a time of political turmoil and spiritual despair, shared a message of hope and light. Against a backdrop of uncertainty, fear, oppression, and spiritual hunger, the prophet declared, *“The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. For those who live in a land of deep darkness, a light will shine,”* (Isaiah 9:2). *“For a child is born to us, a son is given to us. The government will rest on his shoulders. And he will be called: Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. His government and its peace will never end,”* (Isaiah 9:6-7).

Light symbolizes the presence of God. The prophecy is fulfilled in the birth of Jesus Christ, God’s Son, sent to be the Light of the World! He comes to bring the light of God’s presence into the darkness of our world. He brings forgiveness, redemption, healing, hope, comfort, courage, and purpose — life in all its fullness. He reveals the nature, character, and heart of God. He introduces a kingdom that will have no end, and he invites all of us to step into the light.

In John’s Gospel we read, *“The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it,”* (John 1:5). God’s light for our world today is the revelation of Himself in the person of Jesus Christ, the Light of the World who conquered the darkness of death with a radiant resurrection, vindicating everything he taught about his Father, the Kingdom, himself, and us as both true and trustworthy. Jesus reveals God’s intention and desire for all humankind — life in all its fullness through faith in him.

Once again, this Christmas we have the opportunity to reflect, celebrate, and worship the God who steps down into darkness and brings light.

Friends, stay with me a little more. Jesus said to his followers, *“You are the light of the world,”* (Matthew 5:14). You. Me. Us! This is the beautiful purpose of people who belong to God through faith in Christ. We become vessels through whom the light of God is revealed: hope and healing, truth and grace, compassion and mercy, forgiveness and love. Light!

“God, can you leave the light on?”

“I have.”

May God reveal again His light as you celebrate this Christmas. May we, who have placed our faith in His Son, shine like stars in the universe as living testimonies to the power and sufficiency of Jesus, the Light of the World.

God bless you.
