# Our Kids are the Church of Today: Youth Conference 2025

Youth Conference 2025 was a vibrant and Spirit-filled success! Held during Commissioning Weekend, June 6-8, this year’s conference welcomed children ages 5-12 for a time of worship, fun, and intentional discipleship. Throughout the main sessions, kids gathered to explore what it means to live out their faith in real, tangible ways with their families, friends, and in their communities. 

The weekend’s teachings drew from a blend of Orange’s “Live It Out” vacation Bible school (VBS) material and The Salvation Army’s own territorial curriculum, “Under the Stars,” created by the Territorial Youth Department. This dynamic mix laid a solid foundation for spiritual growth while keeping things engaging and age appropriate. 

Each session focused on a different aspect of living out faith. On Friday night, the kids learned about loving one another through the powerful example of Jesus washing His disciples’ feet (John 13). On Saturday morning, they explored the topic of forgiveness, reflecting on Jesus’ sacrifice and resurrection (John 18-20). That evening, the focus turned to prayer, guided by Jesus’ own words in the Lord’s Prayer (Matthew 6). Finally, on Sunday morning, the children learned about serving others, inspired by the early church community found in Acts 2:42-47. 

In addition to Bible teaching, kids experienced the fun and fellowship of VBS-style rotations with crafts, games, snacks, and small groups. From making homemade foot scrubs to playing wild and wacky games, to diving deeper into the Word, every activity pointed back to the central theme: living out our faith with purpose and joy. 

Two standout moments added even more excitement to the weekend. On Saturday night, the kids were treated to a live reptile show featuring lizards, snakes, a tarantula, and even a giant red dragon. This hands-on experience gave the children a chance to marvel at God’s creativity in the animal kingdom — and maybe conquer a few fears along the way! 

Sunday morning brought the weekend to a meaningful close with a special handwashing experience. Just as Jesus humbly served others, delegates and leaders participated in a time of symbolic service and prayer. The Holy Spirit’s presence was tangible as leaders washed the children’s hands and prayed over them, an act of love and a powerful reminder that following Jesus means serving others with humility and grace. 

Youth Conference 2025 was more than just a weekend event. It was a sacred space where faith was formed, friendships were deepened, and young hearts were invited to follow Jesus in everyday life. Through a lot of laughter, learning, and love, our kids were reminded that they are not just the Church of tomorrow, but the Church of today.
