# Getting Real with World Secretary for Women’s Ministries Commissioner Shelley Hill

The Territorial Ministry to Women Department recently launched their “Open Air” podcast, inspired by The Salvation Army’s bold tradition of preaching the gospel in the streets, out in the open. Rooted in Matthew 10:27, *“What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs,”* they bring that same spirit into the digital space. The name is a nod to both the historic Salvation Army open air meetings and being on air for listeners — a fresh take on sharing faith out loud. Each episode features unscripted, authentic conversations with a variety of guests as they explore stories of faith, service, struggles, and hope.

For one of their first episodes, podcast host Ashley Escobar, mission specialist for ministry to women, had the honor of speaking with Commissioner Shelley Hill, world secretary for women’s ministries, from International Headquarters (IHQ), during her recent visit to the Southern Territory.

“With over 30 years of experience in ministry and leadership, Commissioner Hill brings a wealth of wisdom, authenticity, and warmth to every space she enters,” Ashley says. “Her willingness to engage with us so openly speaks volumes about the kind of leader she is — genuine, generous, and deeply connected to the heart of mission.”

Ashley explains that partnering with IHQ on this and other projects is an exciting step forward for women’s ministries. “Through real, relatable conversations like this one, we’re opening doors for deeper connection across cultures, borders, and generations. Commissioner Shelley’s voice on the podcast will not only expand our reach beyond the Southern Territory and the U.S. but also unite women globally in a way that feels fresh, relevant, and Spirit-led. We believe that when women around the world can connect in this way, we position ourselves to experience great things together in Jesus’ name.”

Ashley opens the conversation by asking Commissioner Shelley what has anchored her heart and service through all her seasons of service and varied roles in The Salvation Army.

“First and foremost is God’s Word, relying on His truth, standing firm on His Word,” Commissioner Shelley replies. “The hope that I find throughout scripture keeps me going. But I would say also that my officer’s covenant that I signed 32 years ago keeps me going as well. I signed it as a lifetime commitment.”

“I know that it’s what I’m supposed to do because I have found pleasure in serving,” Commissioner Shelley explains. “I have really found contentment.”

“When I was younger, I never dreamt that I’d be a Salvation Army officer. I attended the corps, I was active, but being an officer has stretched me. It’s given me new areas of ministry and accessibility.” She continues, “I find fulfillment in the tasks that I am called to do.”

“Before I was an officer, I was very reserved and shy,” Commissioner Shelley shares. “It makes us step out of a box of comfort into a larger arena, a larger space where you have to trust the Lord.”

“Officership has empowered me and allowed me to step out into spaces with that boldness, a confidence. It doesn’t mean that I’m not scared or a bit fearful,” she says, “but I go out with the Lord by my side.”

Commissioner Shelley shares that Joshua 1:9 brings her a sense of bravery when tackling demanding situations or brand-new appointments: *“This is my command—Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go,”* (NLT).

“That’s a verse that I have really taken with me through my whole officership,” she confides. “I can do anything through Christ who gives me the strength to do it. If it’s God-honoring, He’s going to equip and use me for whatever I do.”

When Ashley asks what Commissioner Shelley has learned about mentoring and raising up the next generation through her ministry roles, she responds, “You have to be able to have direct and sometimes hard conversations with people, as well as being encouraging.”

“Sometimes we’re just so worried about offending somebody with something you might say as a correction or a little bit of help. But we need to not sugarcoat it; just be truthful.” She specifies that this should be presented in a way that is uplifting, not in any way that might tear others down. “Be encouraging to one another and to those that you’re trying to nurture and mentor and disciple along the way.”

When it comes to their roles as international leaders, Commissioner Shelley and her husband, Chief of the Staff Commissioner Edward Hill, are both very intentional about staying connected to the people they serve, even as their scope of responsibility expands. “I’m first and foremost a soldier before I’m an officer,” Commissioner Shelley explains. “Both my husband and I are active at the Bromley Temple Corps in London.”

In addition to his playing in the band and her participation in songsters, they like to connect with people and be a part of things in the corps. “Recently I oversaw a women’s event at Bromley, and I asked a few men, including my husband, if they would come and help with service. And my husband’s carrying a tray of dishes, and that’s what we’re called to do, whatever needs to be done. If we need to run a vacuum or sweep a hall, we’ll do it.” She continues, “We’re soldiers, and we love soldiering in our corps and being faithful, good tithers, and we just try to take part where we can.”

Commissioner Shelley finds that she also needs to be intentional with self-care as a part of participating in service. “Soul care is very important for all officers and Kingdom workers,” she shares. “I find that God speaks to me through nature… It’s so quiet out there that it just gives my soul a rest. I’m able to listen and possibly hear God speaking to me.” She continues, “Sometimes we feel guilty if we take time for ourselves to take care of our own souls. And we shouldn’t feel guilty.”

“I had a wise officer share with me many years ago that your to-do list will be there tomorrow. Give yourself some grace to take it at your own speed.” She advises women who may be trying to do it all and becoming overwhelmed, “We just need to do what we can, and be kind to yourself. Take time to rest, restore, renew. And the next day, it’ll be there again.”

When Ashley asks what has brought her the most joy during her years of ministry, Commissioner Shelley replies, “People. It’s about people… Being able to see God working in the lives of individuals who come to know Jesus is so beautiful. To see their ups and downs and to see families growing. That brings me such joy.”

“I loved being a corps officer,” she continues. “Besides being a parent, that was my hardest role, my hardest appointment. And it was also my most fulfilling.”

She cites Proverbs 3:5-6 as a scripture that has carried her through difficult seasons in her life: *“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths,”* (NKJV).

“I don’t lean on my strength. I really cannot do anything without Christ empowering me, filling me, using me. It’s all about Christ, and I can’t do it without the Lord.”

When asked what she would say to the woman who may feel unseen, tired, or unsure if she’s making a difference in the world, Commissioner Shelley responds, “Ladies, know that you are loved, valued, and appreciated for all you do for the Kingdom of God. Continue to love on others as Christ loved the world. And enjoy doing it.”
