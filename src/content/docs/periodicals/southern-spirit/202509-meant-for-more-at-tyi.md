# Meant ‘For More’ at TYI

From July 25 to August 1, more than 300 delegates and staff came together at the beautiful Camp Keystone in the Florida Division from all over the Southern Territory for the annual Territorial Youth Institute (TYI). Under the leadership of Territorial Youth Secretaries Majors Matt and Jamie Satterlee and the Territorial Youth Department, this year’s theme, “…For More,” sought to remind delegates that God has so much more for them than they can ever imagine. Each day focused on a specific reminder: that they are Here, Created, Chosen, Saved, Gifted, Called, and Empowered…For More. This all centered around the key verse from Ephesians 3:20, *“God is able to do far more than we could ever ask for or imagine. He does everything by his power that is working in us,”* (NIRV).

Guest speaker Tim Benitez, a youth pastor from Home Church in Roswell, Georgia, poured God’s Word into the delegates, keeping them locked in and eager for more by telling relatable stories, cracking (appropriate) jokes, and using vivid illustrations. This year, delegates were also fortunate to have the founder of the And Campaign, Justin Giboney, speak to them about the importance of getting involved in their communities while being a light for the Lord. At the end of every service the altars were full as delegates surrendered things to God and asked Him to help them grow. Each day, flags marked with their written requests were hung around the stage as a reminder of lives being impacted and changed by the Holy Spirit.

During the week, delegates spent time in D Groups (discussion groups) with their peers digging deeper into what the Lord was revealing to them. They also attended biblically based tracks and fun electives. Tuesday was a special “discovery day” where each delegate took a test to determine their primary spiritual gifts. They then met in groups according to those gifts and were taught more about them and how to use them in their everyday lives for the Kingdom.

The staff of more than 80 officers and local leaders poured into the delegates in remarkable ways — not only in classes, but also during free time, cabin time, and night programs. The staff met each day to talk about incredible moments witnessed where only God could be given the credit for life-changing decisions and honest conversations.

Night programs are always highly anticipated at TYI, and this year did not disappoint. From Scottish dancing with a live Ceilidh band, to “Run the Chaos,” which consisted of every delegate running in, through, and under outlandish obstacles (including mud, Jello, and even spaghetti sauce and noodles), to a night of worship led by the phenomenal house band, and a mystery night where the TYS was kidnapped and delegates had to solve clues to find out whodunit (spoilers — it was Baron Blue), every night had something fun to offer.

All in all, TYI left delegates and staff yearning to know Jesus more and ready to go back to their corps, divisions, families, communities, jobs, and schools with the knowledge that God has created them FOR MORE.
