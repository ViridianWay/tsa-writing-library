# Former Muslim Called to Share Christ

Alex Kargbo has a passion and a dream, and he is waiting for God’s will to be revealed and doors opened in order to make both come to fruition. His story is right out of Act 16:30-32, when the Roman jailer asked Paul and Silas, *“Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house!”*

In the Northern Province of Sierra Leone where Alex grew up, the Islamic population is overwhelmingly dominant at 78 percent. And although The Salvation Army opened the work in Sierra Leone in 2010 (with Captains John and Rosaline Bundt as pioneer officers), so far the ministry is confined to the capital city of Freetown. Now that he is a Blood & Fire Salvationist, Alex dreams of someday returning to his hometown in the Northern Province to preach Christ to his Muslim countrymen.

“I love to preach the Word of God,” Alex says, “but even more, I love serving people.”

As a kid, Alex was fortunate to attend a Christian school where he learned about Jesus, who washed the feet of His disciples and gave to us all the previously unheard-of command to love and serve others as He loves us.

Once introduced to Jesus, the “Servant of All,” the thought of totally giving oneself in service to those in need struck a major chord in Alex’s heart. His conversion to Christianity was met with rejection from most of his family, his father practically disowning him. Only his mother expressed a level of understanding and continued to help him.

Conversely, his father chided Alex. “You have been a Muslim all your life. How can you now follow another faith?”

Alex’s answer to his furious father: “This is what I want to do. This is what I have to do!”

For a long time, Alex’s dad would have very little to do with him. But his mom was more sympathetic, wisely telling Alex, “You need to follow what you want to do!” Alex comments that were it not for his mother’s ongoing support and love, he shudders to think what might have happened to him.

“My family, friends, and neighbors were devout Muslims, and my newfound beliefs in the one true God, loving and serving others, and even the way Christians pray, runs extremely counter to the Islamic faith,” he explains.

When he first converted to Christianity, he didn’t even know how to pray. “All I could do early on was to pray in the Kalima language, the six phases of faith and forgiveness.” Nevertheless, Alex was resolved. Christ would always now be the king of his life.

After grade school graduation, he enrolled in the Freetown Evangelical College of Theology, working toward his bachelor’s in theology. Even then, Alex’s intent was to follow the will of God, wherever that would lead. “God told me that if I followed and trust Him entirely in my life, that He would bring about amazing things that I could never dream of.”

A door later opened for Alex to come to America to live temporarily with his grandmother (by that time also a Christian) in her Roanoke, Virginia home.

“I immediately needed a church home here in America, and the Holy Spirit led me to The Salvation Army.” He says he was greatly drawn by the acts of Christian love and service carried out in the community. “I found that the officers and soldiers of the Roanoke Corps not only preached the gospel, but they put their faith into action by selflessly serving the needs of all people.”

Alex became mentored by his (then) corps officers, Majors Matthew and Cristina Trantham.

“During one of Major Matthew’s sermons, I went to the altar and wept,” Alex recalls, “and I determined that I would best serve God by serving others as a Salvation Army soldier.”

Today, as a uniformed soldier of the Roanoke Corps, Alex is all about working behind the scenes. He takes great joy in cleaning the corps building, sweeping the sidewalks outside the chapel every Sunday, and teaching a Sunday school class. During the week, he is often found volunteering in the corps food pantry, putting together food boxes, and distributing those boxes to needy families.

His green card will expire in 2027, but by that time he hopes to achieve naturalized U.S. citizenship. His nationality in Sierra Leone will still be valid, as there is a provision for dual citizenship, which would enable him to return to Sierra Leone if God opens that door.

“All I want in my life is to do what is right in the sight of the Lord!”

He cites the Great Commission given by Jesus in Matthew 28 as all the motivation he needs to take Christ to the people of his home province.

“The needs of the people in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone are very great,” Alex says. “Most workers earn less than five dollars a day. There is little opportunity to travel or to advance one’s situation. And most of all, a vast majority are without Christ and as such would spend eternity apart from God!”

The covenant Alex made with God remains steadfast, something his family, including his dad, have noticed.

“My father asked me about Jesus ( *What must I do to be saved?* ) and I told him that he needed to confess his sins and to live for God,” Alex joyfully exclaims.

Today, Alex’s entire family–dad, mom, two brothers and two sisters– are all Christians! ( *…and thy house.* )

For Alex, Salvation Army officership is a possibility, but what is definite in his future is the “care and keeping of God’s vineyard.” It all depends on God’s will for him.

“If the General were to ask me if I would be willing to go back to Western Africa to further the work of the Army, I’d salute and say, ‘Yes Sir, I’m gone!’” Alex says with a broad smile.
