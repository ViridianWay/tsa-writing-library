# Love Your Neighbor: Did Someone Mention a Party?

This season is full of opportunities to gather: Thanksgiving and Friendsgiving, Christmas celebrations, end-of-year reflections, and New Year’s festivities. Everywhere you look, parties are happening! It truly is one of the most beautiful times of the year for hosting and connecting with others.

In “The Art of Neighboring,” the authors remind us that these seasonal gatherings aren’t just social events; they can become sacred spaces for building relationships. Whether it’s a simple dessert night or a festive holiday party, every gathering is a chance to foster connection, deepen trust, and live out the call to love our neighbors well.

The book challenges the idea that neighboring must be formal or programmatic. In fact, informal gatherings are often the most effective way to build community. A party lowers barriers. It creates a relaxed atmosphere where people can show up as they are, no pressure, no expectations. This matters especially in neighborhoods where people feel isolated or unsure how to begin connecting.

Hospitality is a biblical practice, deeply rooted in the life of Jesus. Welcoming others into our homes and lives isn’t just a nice gesture; it can be a spiritual discipline. Jesus often used meals and celebrations to connect with people, including those on the margins. In that way, a party becomes a sacred act, a reflection of God’s inclusive love.

Here’s what I love: you don’t need to be an extrovert or have a perfect home to host a meaningful gathering. Honestly, that’s been my concern in the past, worrying my house wasn’t clean enough or big enough, or that I wasn’t the “hostess with the mostess.” But the authors encourage us to start small: invite a few neighbors for dessert, host a front-yard hangout, or plan a simple Christmas get-together.

My parents modeled this beautifully. In their retirement, they began inviting neighbors for a carol sing-along on their lawn right before Christmas. The first year, maybe 10 people came. Ten years later, 70 people showed up! That’s how they built relationships, with simple, consistent invitations. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s presence. When we show up and create space for others, we begin to shift the culture of our neighborhoods.

And here’s something important: parties aren’t about conversion; they’re about connection. The goal isn’t to preach or persuade, but to listen, learn, and love. When neighbors feel seen and valued, trust grows. Over time, those relationships can open doors to deeper conversations and mutual support. But it all starts with a simple invitation.

Neighborhoods that were once disconnected can become vibrant communities through shared meals and celebrations. These stories remind us that neighboring works. When we create space for joy, laughter, and shared life, we reflect the Kingdom of God in tangible ways.

Neighboring doesn’t require a program; it requires a posture — a posture of openness and invitation. By embracing the art of celebration, we can build bridges, heal divisions, and cultivate communities marked by love, grace, and belonging. Whether it’s a backyard barbecue or a Christmas open house, every gathering becomes an opportunity to live out the gospel, one neighbor at a time.

So, what party will you host this year? Let’s celebrate and share our stories of connection!
