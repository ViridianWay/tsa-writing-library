# Jeff Jellets Receives 2025 Career Excellence Award

The Awards and Recognition Committee of the U.S. Council of the International Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM-USA) has selected Jeffrey Jellets for the 2025 Career Excellence Award.

The award recognizes an individual who is a leader who has influenced emergency management throughout the nation or made a national impact due to their significant contributions and achievements throughout their career to promote and improve the emergency management profession in the USA.

Jeff serves as the territorial disaster coordinator for The Salvation Army Southern Territory, overseeing emergency operations across 15 states and the District of Columbia. In this position, he has demonstrated exceptional leadership, strategic vision, and unwavering commitment to building resilient communities. His skill in coordinating complex operations across diverse regions has set a standard for excellence in emergency management.

Under his visionary leadership, The Salvation Army has responded to some of the most devastating disasters in recent history, including Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Irma, Michael, Florence, Ian, and most recently, Hurricanes Helene and Milton. His guidance in numerous tornado and flood responses has ensured the consistent delivery of high-quality mass care, logistics support, and long-term recovery services across the territory.

Over his 33-year career, Jeff has made remarkable contributions to the field at every level — local, state, and federal. His work has shaped policy, improved operational efficiency, and strengthened collaborative frameworks that are now central to modern emergency response. He has played a key part in elevating the role of the voluntary sector, ensuring that community- based organizations are fully integrated into all phases of emergency management efforts.

As a trusted liaison between FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), VOAD (Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster), and the broader emergency management community, he has fostered partnerships that transcend organizational boundaries. Jeff’s advocacy for inclusive and coordinated response systems has resulted in more effective disaster relief and recovery across the country. Colleagues consistently praise his integrity, professionalism, and ability to lead with both compassion and precision under pressure.

Jeff exemplifies the highest standards of emergency management. His national service, visionary leadership, and tireless dedication to professional excellence make him not only a role model but also an ideal recipient of the Career Excellence Award. His legacy will continue to inspire future generations of emergency management professionals.
