# The USA Southern Staff Band Ministers in South Africa

In early October, the Southern Staff Band (SSB) set out on a ten-day tour of South Africa that would prove to be a life-changing endeavor for all involved. The South Africa tour was the first international voyage for the ensemble since 2018, providing the opportunity to worship and minister with soldiers and officers at three corps of the Southern Africa Territory, as well as to serve as key faculty for a music and arts camp for more than 100 young people.

Prior to the international portion of the ministry trip, the SSB gathered at the Evangeline Booth College in Atlanta for a period of preparation, rehearsal, and prayer, setting the tone for what was to come. Perhaps the most powerful moment came from the rehearsal of “Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus,” arranged by Paul Sharman. The piece, which was also shared in ministry on multiple occasions in South Africa, allowed the band to keep its focus on Jesus for the duration of the experience.

Throughout the journey, the band began each day with devotional meetings led by Major Mike Harris, SSB chaplain and area commander in Greenville, South Carolina. Each session centered on a “word of the day,” including trust, pray, prepare, worship, joy, expect, receive, thanks, and testimony.

On the first day of the trip, Major Harris challenged the band: “We should be looking not at what we are as a band, but who are,” sharing the importance of “trusting the Lord in every step of the process.” As the trip neared its conclusion, Major Harris spoke on next steps, focusing on testimony and the need to not allow the experience to end in South Africa.

“We must take our testimonies back with us,” he said. “We must share what God has done. Share with people, individually or corporately, and do not let the things that happened here stay here. Bring His joy, His faithfulness, back with us, and have Him guide our steps.”

Midway through the trip, the band gathered to share short testimonies and stories of how the Lord was moving in their lives even amid the busy schedule. This was a powerful time of reflection that allowed members of the band to put the scope of the trip’s impact into perspective.

The first day on the ground in South Africa, Saturday, October 4, was spent at the Peart Memorial Corps, located in the White City community of Soweto. The day featured a festive atmosphere, beginning with an outdoor dedication ceremony of a new corps building and celebrating the 75th anniversary of The Salvation Army’s work in that community. The theme verse of the weekend was Deuteronomy 7:9, with an intentional celebration of God’s faithfulness.

“This is not simply a regular place. This is an important place,” said Commissioner Torben Eliasen, territorial commander for Southern Africa. “I want to remind us all that this house belongs to Jesus… For 75 years, people have encountered God here. May it continue to be a house of prayer for all nations and all people.”

The outdoor dedication featured inspiring singing from the Peart Memorial Songsters, as well as a charge to continue the Lord’s work for another 75 years and beyond.

“What a day of celebration this is,” said Commissioner Donna Igleheart, president of women’s ministries for the USA Southern Territory. “For 75 years, people have come desperate for hope and found it in this place. They have found restoration here. They have found grace and a friend in Jesus here.”

The remainder of the day included a pair of meetings at Peart Memorial, both in celebration of the anniversary and in praise to God for his power and faithfulness. The Peart Memorial Band also shared musical ministry, with recognition of officers, soldiers, and community leaders who worked together to ensure the building process was completed.

“We’ve been to this beautiful and sacred place many times over the years, and it always does our hearts good to be here,” said Commissioner Kelly Igleheart, USA Southern Territorial commander. Commissioners Igleheart previously served as the chief secretaries for the Southern Africa Territory, and that relationship helped to pave the way for the SSB’s ministry trip. “When we entered the hall, I wanted to fall to my knees,” Commissioner Igleheart said. “Peart Memorial has such a rich history. The presence of the Lord is here, and it has already been here for many years.”

One contagious and powerful element of worship in the Southern African territory is the spontaneous nature of the singing and musical offerings that permeate each gathering. Between meeting elements, transitions are often met by the boisterous singing of choruses, sometimes a cappella and other times accompanied by the sound of drums to provide a pulsing rhythm and inspire dancing and movement. This was evident from the first moments on the opening day at Peart Memorial and remained persistent throughout the journey.

“I’ve been all over the world and I’ve never heard singing like that in my life,” said Dr. Steve Kellner, euphonium player and band sergeant. “As we say in both Zulu and English, wow!”

“After just one meeting at the Peart Memorial Corps, our task seemingly became more daunting,” said Matt Broome, divisional music director in Texas and SSB bass trombone player. “What could we offer a people that worship so wholly, and always in perfect harmony? What could they learn from us? As is typically the case with these kinds of trips, we learned more from them, and we came away changed for the better.”

In tandem with the Southern Staff Band, the Peart Memorial Corps displayed its thriving musical and artistic ministry. This included items from the corps band, songster brigade, youth band, youth chorus, timbrels, and Home League, in addition to a vocal quartet composed of young people from the corps that would rival any professional effort in any corner of the world for its power, polish, and impact.

Sunday, October 5, began with a march of witness as the SSB and Peart Memorial Band combined to take to the streets near the corps. It was a memorable time that also helped to remind SSB members of the realities of life in that community.

“The march of witness was definitely a highlight,” said Nick Simmons-Smith, territorial music and creative arts education secretary and SSB bandmaster. “As we marched around the streets of Soweto, in extreme poverty, people on the street welcomed the sight of the band and The Salvation Army.”

The march was followed by Sunday morning worship, with Commissioner Donna Igleheart reflecting on Philippians 1 and Commissioner Kelly Igleheart sharing the morning’s message with a focus on Psalm 34. “God, we ask you to examine our hearts,” Commissioner Kelly said. “Create new hearts for us in you. We know you never leave nor forsake us, and we dedicate ourselves to you.”

Following morning worship, the SSB moved to the Johannesburg City Corps for an afternoon “Songs of Praise” meeting in a packed and energetic auditorium. The Southern Africa Territory’s Central Division band and songsters offered a memorable rendition of “Breathe,” arranged by Captain Dorothy Gates, corps officer in Staunton, Virginia and a world-class composer who also plays trombone in the SSB.

As part of the afternoon praise meeting, the SSB debuted “He Died for Me,” a sing-along worship medley using South African tunes arranged by Matt Broome. The piece was warmly received during each presentation, with joyous singing emerging at the hint of each tune. Broome describes the medley as being based on previous worship experiences in Africa.

“Writing the medley was my way to honor them and represent their culture in the brass band medium that they have embraced,” Broome said. “It was a joy to hear them sing this medley at multiple locations throughout the week, and I believe they felt seen. Their brass bands typically play hymn tunes, marches, and more traditional TSA repertoire, but not many African tunes. An officer later shared with me that hearing us play their music made it feel acceptable for the first time. They also have several up-and-coming composers we heard from throughout the week, so hopefully this continues to encourage them toward fusion with the brass band and their cultural melodies and rhythms.”

Following the rousing opening weekend, the band’s sights were set on the Southern African Territorial Music Camp, which took place from Monday, October 6, through Saturday, October 11. The camp’s theme was “Unleash Your Artistic Expression of Praise,” with a focus on Psalm 150 and especially on the sixth verse: “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.”

Lt. Colonel Allan Hofer, territorial secretary for program and SSB executive officer, spoke during the camp’s opening night program, encouraging all attendees to center their thoughts on the Lord. “Be open to the Holy Spirit,” Lt. Colonel Hofer said. “He is here, and He will do amazing things in your lives this week.” He later challenged the delegates to not allow the experience to stay only at camp but rather fuel their mission back at home. “I need you to go and believe in Jesus,” he said. “Your corps needs you to go and believe in Jesus. Your community needs you to go and believe in Jesus.”

Each day at the camp featured a busy schedule of classes, with SSB personnel mixing with local leaders to serve on a comprehensive faculty. Delegates chose a major discipline, including brass, percussion, dance, and timbrels, and they also explored a daily workshop, electives, and choir classes. The schedule was both grueling and deeply rewarding, with clear artistic and spiritual advances taking place over the week.

“We brought material resources and arts instruction to the music camp,” said Dr. Steve Kellner. “They brought talent, commitment, and spirit. In those areas, they were the teachers, and we were the students.”

“More than 30 timbrellists gathered together on a dusty patch each day, eager to praise God with their whole heart,” said Bethany Farrell, territorial creative arts director and SSB alto horn player. “Smiles stretched wide, jingles rattling — these beautiful artists reinforced in me the importance of giving our best in all that we do. It doesn’t matter if your timbrel is held together with tape, or if your last ribbons are fraying: a joyful offering of praise will always be returned with blessings upon blessings. I was honored to spend the week with these beautiful timbrellists and consider it one of the most profound experiences of my life.”

The band led a “USA Night” on Tuesday, October 7, that doubled as a concert of sorts and featured renditions of the “Star-Spangled Banner” and “America, the Beautiful,” as well as an arrangement of the national anthem of South Africa. Later in the week, the Southern African delegates more than returned the favor, with the band experiencing an evening program titled “Africa Worship Explosion” that featured authentic dance, reading, clothing, and, most importantly, worship of our Lord.

“There is nothing else in the Church Universal like the fellowship between Salvationists around the world,” Dr. Kellner shared. “Within the Army, there is also nothing else quite like the fellowship between Salvationist musicians and worship artists.”

Within the week-plus visit, the band was also able to spend a brief time in tourist activity, including a visit to the Bothongo Rhino & Lion Nature Reserve and a walking tour of the Mandela House. SSB personnel were also able to view Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s home, in addition to being guided through the local community and educated on the Soweto uprising that began nearby in 1976.

While the busy camp schedule persisted, the band visited a pair of Salvation Army children’s homes in the area, ministering to local youth with not only music but also fellowship. A small ensemble spent an afternoon at Ethembeni Children’s Home with infants and toddlers ages 0-3, and later in the week, the entire SSB spent an evening at Carl Sithole Children’s Home. The facility is home to nearly 100 children between the ages of 3-18, and SSB personnel toured the grounds before engaging in a concert that will not soon be forgotten.

“There is a quote from Gangai Victor that resonates deeply with me: ‘Worship is the natural response of man to the supernatural presence of God.’ I felt this firsthand when the young people at the children’s home joined with the band in singing,” said Darryl Crossland, assistant divisional music director in Florida and SSB soprano cornet player. “Despite most being abandoned at birth, they sang with incredible joy, ‘What shall I render to Jehovah? For He has done so very much for me…’ Their passion renewed my own, reminding me why I have dedicated my life to this work.”

“The visit to the children’s home brought simultaneous emotions of joy and sadness,” Simmons- Smith said. “These young people were so full of joy, despite living in difficult circumstances. It challenged me to be more grateful and thankful to the Lord for what I have.”

The music and arts camp concluded on Saturday, October 11, with a festival at Johannesburg City Corps that featured performances from each major ensemble, award presentations, certificates for each delegate, and worship that was praise-filled and invigorating.

“I look out, and I see the future of The Salvation Army in our territory,” said Lt. Colonel Themba Mahlobo, chief secretary for the Southern Africa Territory. “Young people, you have a place in The Salvation Army. You have a place in the Church. You are the present, and you are the future… The best is yet to come for the Southern Africa Territory.”

As part of the final festival, two delegates were presented with scholarships to the 2026 Southern Territorial Music Institute (TMI), and the band left multiple instruments behind to supplement the ongoing work in South Africa.

The SSB concluded its visit with Sunday morning worship on October 12 in the Kwa Thema Corps, ministering alongside the corps band, corps songsters, and a Sunday school group that presented a worshipful dance. The band’s special musical offering of “The Beauty of Thy Peace,” arranged by Gates, was impactful and indelible. Andy Barrington, SSB deputy bandmaster, offered a poignant testimony of God’s faithfulness in the lives of his family and the Arkansas- Oklahoma Division, and Commissioner Donna Igleheart shared a powerful sermon that included reflection on time spent in South Africa and its impact on their family and ministry.

“The worship services were all wonderful,” Simmons-Smith shared. “The singing was loud and joyous and often accompanied by dancing and marching. There was a sense of the Holy Spirit inspiring people to lead worship, rather than a Westernized, structured approach to the meetings. It was good to feel that freedom.”

Over the course of less than two weeks, it was clear that those in the band saw their lives changed, and at the same time the influence of the SSB’s ministry was evident on the ground in South Africa. Simmons-Smith expressed his gratitude to the band “not only for outstanding musical ministry, but also for how they connected with the people of South Africa and jumped in on every activity, meeting, and chance for fellowship. He also described the journey as “the best ministry trip I have been a part of,” and Simmons-Smith was certainly not alone in that thinking.

“I think it is safe to say as a band that this is a trip we will never, ever forget,” said Tom Hanton, territorial worship arts education director and SSB trombone player. “We were so blessed, both collectively and individually. God knew what would happen before it happened. And the journey happened exactly the way it should have.”

“I’ve been playing in Salvation Army bands for more than 50 years and have been on more than 200 ministry trips over that time,” said Greg Payton, SSB cornet player. “Never have I been anywhere in which we left with such a blessing.”

Though it is difficult to put into words the wide-ranging impact of a trip such as this, stories and memories will permeate for a lifetime, with the Lord at the center of each and every step.
