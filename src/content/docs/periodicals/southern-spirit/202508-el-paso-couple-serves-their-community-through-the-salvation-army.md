# El Paso Couple Serves Their Community Through The Salvation Army

Mark and Debbie Bell’s journey with The Salvation Army began with a simple prayer and a trip to Costco. After caring for Mark’s mother through the height of the COVID pandemic, the couple found themselves searching for a church home and a place to serve. As they walked into the El Paso Costco one morning, they noticed a couple ahead of them wearing Salvation Army attire. The ensuing conversation with Majors Floiran and Eloisa Estrada led to a great visit to The Salvation Army Family Center.

“It was as if we were visiting with a friend we had known for years,” Debbie recalls. Shortly afterward, they attended their first Sunday service at the El Paso Citadel Corps. A warm welcome — and a sense of God’s leading — convinced them to stay. They’ve been there ever since.

Their journey as volunteers began in January 2023 and quickly deepened. On May 22 of that year, they launched a weekly Bible study at the family shelter. Now, more than two years later, they continue to lead this ministry every Monday night, offering scripture, prayer, snacks, and a listening ear to residents facing some of life’s hardest moments.

“People staying at the [shelter] aren’t usually here because they’re having a great day,” Mark shares. “There’s often a desperate need. And through God’s Word, we can encourage them and help them understand there’s life in the midst of difficulty.” He adds, “It’s a great opportunity to meet new people and to share Jesus.”

Throughout the year, Mark and Debbie also support numerous events: vacation Bible school, the Music & Arts Conservatory, fundraisers, Angel Tree, and the Red Kettle Campaign. Their energy and joy are evident in everything they do. “This is not work,” Mark says with a smile. “This is fun!”

In recognition of their remarkable dedication, Mark and Debbie were named Volunteers of the Year at the 2025 Lone Star Gala — setting a record as the first recipients to earn the honor two years in a row.

For the Bells, serving with The Salvation Army is not just a way to give back — it’s a way to live out their faith. In addition to volunteering, Mark and Debbie also give regularly to support the mission and encourage others to do the same. “If someone has a desire to contribute financially to an organization that puts feet to their finances, The Salvation Army is where you want to go,” Mark declares.

Their story is a powerful reminder that when people follow God’s prompting and show up with open hearts, He can use them to help transform lives — including their own.
