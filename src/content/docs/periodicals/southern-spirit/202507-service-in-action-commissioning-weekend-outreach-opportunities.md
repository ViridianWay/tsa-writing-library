# Service in Action: Commissioning Weekend Outreach Opportunities

After being encouraged to serve wholeheartedly and inclusively in the first two sessions of Commissioning Weekend, delegates were given the opportunity to put their faith into action, serving local communities in two locations in the Atlanta area.

“It’s time to get up and do something,” Colonel Deborah Sedlar, territorial chief secretary, exhorted. “We are people of the King. We are saved and we are called to serve the Almighty. So do that today without hesitation.”

Major Lynda Thornhill, mission, evangelism, and cultural ministries secretary, explained that the outreach events would be staffed by the divisions split up into the two locations. Those who signed up were encouraged to eat lunch with their divisional liaison for the event to receive additional instructions and have any questions answered.

“You can do this,” Major Thornhill emphasized. “But more importantly, you can do this at home. Maybe it’s just you and a friend going visiting in your corps’ neighborhood. Or maybe it’s a group of friends that are taking the canteen and serving food in your community. You can do as little or as much as what is happening today, and we pray that you are inspired… We are called to go.”

Armed with matching SERVE t-shirts and a card full of conversation starters, delegates were empowered to be the hands and feet of Jesus in neighborhoods served by the Atlanta Kroc Center and the Atlanta Temple Corps.

### Atlanta Kroc Center

Despite oppressive heat, many soldiers and leaders traveled south from the Atlanta Temple Corps to the Atlanta Kroc Center for an afternoon of outreach, fellowship, worship, and fun. Groups took to the surrounding neighborhoods, encouraging all to come together, and [the National Capital Band](https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/stories/service-in-action-commissioning-weekend-outreach-opportunities/https://salvationarmyusa.org/all-stories/national-capital-band-celebrates-100-years-of-serving-god-through-music/) attracted plenty of positive attention.

The band led an open-air meeting featuring lively, upbeat music and testimonies of God’s goodness in their lives. The appealing nature of a brass band in an outdoor setting undoubtedly led to more congregants, and the surrounding activities were plentiful.

Local vendors supported the event, including a shaved ice truck, a mobile video gaming station, and indoor bounce houses. In addition, stations were set up for face painting and outdoor games, with a canteen on-site to provide food and drink.

A group from TAM (Territorial Arts Ministry) also provided what was described as an abbreviated “Jesus Theater” production, aimed to minister to both children and adults. Looks of awe and wonder were present on the faces of young people, and one attendee loudly proclaimed the event as “the highlight of the month!”

### Atlanta Temple Corps

The divisions supporting the Atlanta Temple Corps outreach traveled just a few minutes down the road to Woodward Elementary School. There they formed teams to go into the surrounding neighborhood, inviting families to come join the fun.

While those teams visited nearby apartment complexes, other groups set up tents and stations in the school’s parking lot. The Gwinnett County Corps canteen served snacks and cold water, and a bounce house, lawn games, cake walk, temporary tattoo station, and prayer ministry stations filled up the rest of the space.

As families began to filter into the parking lot, they were given a Salvation Army tote bag, a John 3:16 bracelet, and a smile. The Southern Staff Songsters gave a short concert, and then a group from the TAM team presented the gospel through a creative pantomime, afterwards explained by Bethany Farrell, territorial creative arts director, and translated into Spanish by Captain Marianne Villanueva, corps officer for the Bryan College Station, TX Corps.

Even in the sweltering temperatures, people lingered under the shaded tents to receive the gospel message, many participating in a repeated prayer of salvation.

“Service transcends language barriers,” Major Chris Thornhill, mission, evangelism, and cultural ministries secretary, said with emotion following the successful outreach event. “Love your people, and everything will work out. If you love them, then they won’t mind the language barrier.”
