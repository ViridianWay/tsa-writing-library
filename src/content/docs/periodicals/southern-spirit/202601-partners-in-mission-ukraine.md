# Partners in Mission: Ukraine

A growing Army of soldiers and friends whose resilience is second to none, for whom adversity simply means pressing on even harder, meeting needs in the community and providing opportunities for all ages to worship and grow in their faith — this is The Salvation Army in Ukraine.

From the early beginnings of The Salvation Army’s work in this beautiful country of nearly 39 million people, distribution of humanitarian aid has opened doors for spiritual work which has been transformative for local communities and individuals who have encountered the love of Christ, perhaps for the first time.

Despite the full-scale war on Ukraine, from 2022 to 2024 alone, more than 800 Salvationists and almost 600 other attendees gathered for spiritual seminars, and more than 5,700 children attended Sunday school. During this same timeframe, throughout the eight corps of the Ukraine division, spanning from the most eastern part close to the border with Russia to the most western part of the country, over 8,500 teens attended Salvation Army spiritual programs and camps, and 253,551 individuals received humanitarian aid.

Yuri is a citizen of Kharkiv whose family home, built in 1933, is now destroyed by shelling. He was able to find help through The Salvation Army, which provided humanitarian aid in the form of a tent, two beds, two sleeping bags, two tables, two chairs, a gas cylinder with a stove, a kettle, and necessary utensils. Yuri said, “Thank you for coming here to us and bringing such wonderful gifts! Now, I have a place to rest while I renovate my house. I have a place to cook and even sleep. Your kindness gives me hope and faith in the future because we are not alone and the world supports us. Thank you!”

In the summer of 2025, more than 70 children and teens from various parts of the country got to participate in a Salvation Army scout camp in peaceful surroundings. Away from the stress of war and the sounds of explosions, they played sports and games with new friends, experiencing laughter, joy, rest, and rejuvenation. Several accepted Jesus as their Savior, praying for the very first time. Since the beginning of the war, more than 50 new senior soldiers and 20 new junior soldiers have been enrolled.

From generation to generation, hope is real. Resilience is the mark of deep-rooted faith and prayer by true salvation warriors who rely on God and on their brothers and sisters from around the world to help meet the desperate needs in their communities.

As officers, soldiers, and friends of The Salvation Army in Ukraine meet the needs all around them amidst shelling and frequent stays in bomb shelters, they do so with love, kindness, faith, prayer, and hope. The level of innovation and ability to stretch a dollar cannot be overstated. Our Ukrainian brothers and sisters are faithful stewards of each gift God bestows on them, and you and I get to participate by tangibly showing our support.
