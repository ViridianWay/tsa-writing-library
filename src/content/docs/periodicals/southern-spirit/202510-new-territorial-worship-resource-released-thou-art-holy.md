# New Territorial Worship Resource Released: 'Thou Art Holy'

The Southern Territory released its latest worship resource on September 26 — a fulllength album of choral worship music entitled “Thou Art Holy” presented by the Southern Staff Songsters (SSS). The album, recorded by the Southern Territory’s premiere choral group during a recent ministry weekend, is intended as a resource for both individual and corporate worship.

“This is the first recording released by the Staff Songsters that will not have any physical product but will be available at all major streaming outlets including Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music,” Robert Snelson, territorial worship arts publications director and SSS leader, tells us.

“Thou Art Holy” was created to worship God, and it holds something that will connect with everyone, Robert shares. “There are devotional choral works such as Elaine Hagenberg’s ‘O, Love,’ or ‘Precious Lord’ by Arnold Sevier. The title track is an arrangement of the hymn ‘Holy, Holy, Holy’ by Craig Courtney, which is pensive at the start but builds to a bold declaration before returning to a reflective close. There are also arrangements of contemporary worship songs like ‘Goodness of God’ or ‘The Fear of the Lord,’ which has more of a gospel feel.” The album provides diverse styles and a wide selection, inviting listeners to join the Southern Staff Songsters in worshipping our Savior through these musical offerings.

“We are also excited to soon release lyric videos of all twelve tracks, which we hope will be especially useful in worship services,” Robert says. Adding the visual element will allow for additional use of the music in Sunday corps worship services or to elevate individual worship. The videos will be available for download on Ministry Toolkit or to view on YouTube.

“Our Southern Territory encompasses fifteen states, which is a large area to cover with this one group. Making a recording like this is a way that we can share our ministry with everyone all at once! We pray that this recording will be used to share the glory of God to all who hear it.”

“Thou Art Holy” is available for digital listening on all major platforms, and lyric videos will soon be available for download on Ministry Toolkit.
