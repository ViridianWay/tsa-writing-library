# Commencement 2025: Champions of the Mission Encouraged to be Humble and Bold

The first event of Commissioning Weekend 2025 honored the cadets of the Champions of the Mission session for their accomplishments over the last two years. On the morning of Friday, June 6, Chief Secretary Colonel Deborah Sedlar welcomed both the cadets and those gathered at the Atlanta Temple Corps to support them.

“We are here to ratify, to recognize, and to reward the hard work of our Champions of the Mission,” Colonel Sedlar said. “They have studied, practiced, implemented, and acquired new skills and understanding during their time at the Evangeline Booth College (EBC). They have met all of the requirements in the completion of their training program. Now, it is time to celebrate these beloved cadets and cheer them on for what’s to come.”

Colonel Sedlar also focused on 2 Timothy 2:15, referencing the verse as a “seal upon the work that has been done.”

> *“Do everything you can to present yourself to God as a man who is fully genuine, a worker unashamed of your mission, a guide capable of leading others along the correct path defined by the word of truth.”*

The service also featured lively musical moments, including the congregational singing of “Sound the Battle Cry” and transMission leading worship with the singing of “Goodness of God.” One clear highlight was the EBC Family Choir, composed of employees, cadets, and officers, singing “I Speak Jesus” and helping to bring everyone in attendance to the feet of Jesus.

Cadet Sarresa Thorson addressed those present as the representative speaker for the Champions of the Mission session, reflecting on the time spent with session mates in both ministry and fellowship. In reference to the unique experience of serving through emergency disaster relief, Cadet Thorson said, “we got to see what we were made of,” and she offered a closing challenge to her fellow cadets: “Be willing to see yourselves through the eyes of others, but always know how God sees you.” She continued, “Stay in your Word. The advancement of the Kingdom is reliant upon the commitment you have toward His people. Please do not get lost or disappear into the work without remembering to look up.”

> “Start strong. Stay focused. Keep going in God’s strength. Guard your heart. Stay faithful, and finish strong. You are a Champion.”

Cadet Donna Shea earned the Principal’s Award, with Cadet Jeremy Warf earning the Commissioner’s Award, the highest honor given to a cadet upon their commissioning. The Champions of the Mission were also presented with their official diplomas, recognizing their educational journeys.

“With great joy and in the presence of family, friends, officers, and fellow believers, we recognize these cadets as faithful stewards of their calling,” said Captain Kelsey Bridges, EBC director of curriculum. “And we commend them for their diligence, sacrifice, and perseverance.”

Envoy Dr. Bill Ury, national ambassador of holiness, delivered the commencement address, both encouraging and challenging the session. He included a focus on humility as the first sign of a Spirit-filled existence. “When you’re filled with the Holy Spirit, the first result is humility… You’re not about yourself,” he said. “The glory of God the Father in the Son by the Spirit is the same glory you bear from this room as you go.”

He also spoke on the necessity of stepping out of our comfort zones and taking risks in service of Jesus. “I don’t want to take care,” Envoy Dr. Ury said. “I want to take a risk. I don’t want to take care in life. I want to risk everything in Jesus. There’s just too much ‘take care’ in the church. We’ve got to take a risk.”

He encouraged the Champions of the Mission to surrender control and let Jesus be the one to measure and lead their ministry. “As you go to your places of ministry, with your families, with your friends, I want to say He is the one who is going to measure your spiritual experience, not you,” he said. “He’s got more for you. Even though you’re filled with the Spirit today, He’s got more for you. Wherever you’re serving, He is going to fill your morning devotion time, or whenever you have time with Him, with the vision that He has for your people.”

> “Let Him measure your life and ministry. Whatever He measures, He offers himself in perfect, protective glory. He knows exactly what we need, but He wants to fill you to overflowing with His glorious holy presence.”

At the conclusion of the morning, Captain Joshua Hinson, EBC director of mission and ministry, led the singing of “We Shall Win,” sending attendees out with the knowledge and strength that “we already know the winner of this great salvation war.”

Captain Hinson also congratulated the Champions of the Mission. “Champions, you did it! We’re here. The day is here, and we are so proud of you,” he said. “Are you ready to risk it all for Jesus? Are you ready to go to the field? We know that you are.”
