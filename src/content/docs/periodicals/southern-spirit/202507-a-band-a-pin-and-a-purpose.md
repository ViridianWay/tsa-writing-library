# A Band, a Pin, and a Purpose

“When I was just five years old, I saw a poster at my school about a brass band from Texas giving a free concert that night,” says Kevin Herrera. “I didn’t even know what a brass band was, or anything about The Salvation Army, but something in me really wanted to go.”

Kevin, who lived in La Paz, Bolivia, ran home to ask his family, but his dad was busy, his mom was working late, and his sister had classes. “I was so sad. I thought I’d have to miss it,” Kevin says. “But then my aunt showed up unexpectedly. I asked her if we could go, and she said yes.”

That night, Kevin and his aunt found seats near the back of the school coliseum. “The Dallas Temple band came out in their blue suits, and as soon as they started playing, I was completely captivated,” says Kevin. “I didn’t understand the music or even know what instruments they were playing. But I remember the energy and passion of the conductor and how the music made me feel. Now I know—it was the Holy Spirit.”

After the concert, people swarmed the band like they were celebrities. “The band members were giving out little pins shaped like the state of Texas,” Kevin says. “I really wanted one, but there were too many people. So, we just sat and waited for my mom.”

Then something unforgettable happened.

“An older man from the band approached me. He smiled, opened his instrument case, and handed me a Texas pin. I couldn’t believe it,” Kevin recalls. “At that moment, I knew—I wanted to play an instrument and be just like them.”

Years later, Kevin met Jesus at a Salvation Army youth camp and started to learn an instrument. “At 18, I joined my corps band. I became the principal euphonium and eventually the bandmaster.”

In 2025, Kevin’s musical journey came full circle. The Texas Divisional Band visited Bolivia, with a small group traveling early to lead a music camp for 250 young people. Philip Burn, who was the bandmaster of the Dallas Temple Band during his last visit to La Paz in 2000, is now a member of this divisional group. Kevin was one of the leaders of the camp and was assigned to be a translator during the week, specifically for Philip’s band.

“After 25 years, I finally met the conductor from that night, Philip Burn, when he came to Bolivia. Playing under him at our music camp and working with him during the week was a dream come true,” Kevin shares. “God had a purpose all along.”

“What a blessing to have the opportunity to visit Bolivia again after so many years,” says Burn, who continues as bandmaster, now at the Lewisville Corps in Texas. “The young people and leaders at the music camp were wonderful, and I was deeply moved when Kevin shared his story of hearing the Dallas Temple Band so many years ago. You truly never know the influence you have as part of Salvation Army music ministry and how God can use you.”

“That Texas pin wasn’t just a gift,” says Kevin. “It was a seed planted by God.”
