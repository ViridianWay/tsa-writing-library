# Love Your Neighbor: Posture is Everything

As we come to the close of this journey through “The Art of Neighboring,” let’s take a moment to reflect. How about you pull up a chair, pour yourself a hot chocolate and ask yourself: How has your neighboring been going this Christmas season? Have you been engaged? Have you prayed for those living around you? Have you extended invitations, not just to events, but into your life? Have you noticed the opportunities right in front of you, truly getting to know your neighbors and building meaningful relationships?

This was never meant to be a seasonal project, or a campaign, or just a way to pass time. It was not about sharing a quick evangelism strategy with you. If conversion were our only motive, we would have failed you greatly. Why? Because relationships that are built on hidden agendas are fragile and insincere. People can sense when they’re being treated as a “project.” That’s not love; that’s manipulation. We would never want to share with you something that’s built upon manipulation.

You see, we don’t love our neighbors to change them; we love them because *we have been changed*. Do you see the difference? Our love flows from the transformation Christ has already worked in us. It’s not a bait-and-switch. Jesus never called us to pretend friendship just to share spiritual truths. He called us to love others, period. And when we love authentically, God does the rest. Our calling is simple: be present, be real, and let God work in His timing.

Jesus said, *“You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven,”* (Matthew 5:14-16).

When we live authentically and love genuinely, our light shines. People will notice. Some will respond; others may not. But that’s not our responsibility. It’s God’s.

Neighboring is not complicated. It’s about showing up in ordinary ways, sharing a meal, listening to a story, and offering help when needed. It’s about being kind without expecting anything in return. It’s about creating space for conversations that go deeper than surface-level small talk. And yes, sometimes those conversations will turn spiritual. But even if they don’t, the relationship still matters. Every person is made in the image of God, and every story is worth hearing.

So, as we head into a new year, let’s recommit to the art of neighboring. Knock on a door. Share a plate of cookies. Invite someone to coffee. Pray for the homes around you. Ask questions. Listen well. Celebrate together. Mourn together. Live life side by side. These small acts of love can ripple into something far greater than we can imagine.

Remember, the art of neighboring is simple: be genuine, be kind, and let God do the rest. When we embrace this posture, we reflect the heart of Jesus in a world desperate for real connection. And that, friends, is the true gift we can offer, not just at Christmas, but every day.
