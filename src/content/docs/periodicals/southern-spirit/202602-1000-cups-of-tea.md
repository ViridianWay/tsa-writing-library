# ‘1000 Cups of Tea’

As we step into a new year, we begin a new book together. I’m not sure how many were able to read our last recommendation, but I truly hope you’ll join us this time as we journey through “1000 Cups of Tea” by Preston Fidler. It feels like the perfect way to start the year, with a book that invites us to slow down, pay attention, deepen our relationships with the people around us, and drink tea together. I’m looking forward to reading it alongside you.

The majority of readers may not have had the opportunity to travel internationally, acquire a new language, or engage with vastly different cultures. This, however, does not diminish the relevance of the Good News of Jesus, which is intended for everyone and not restricted to those who cross cultural or geographic boundaries. The gospel is designed to be integrated into everyday environments where we reside, work, and interact. What is most significant is not the extent of our travels, but the depth with which we understand, connect with, and care for those within our communities, as well as how thoroughly we incorporate the gospel into our own lives. This message forms the core of Preston Fidler’s “1000 Cups of Tea,” emphasizing that genuine transformation originates from meaningful presence rather than physical location.

Fidler writes about ministry as a long obedience of small, faithful moments: pouring tea, listening well, showing up again and again. We don’t need a passport to practice it; we need a posture. We need a willingness to slow down, to pay attention, and to build relationships that allow trust to grow.

Jesus himself modeled this. Before he preached, he listened. Before he taught, he sat at tables. Before he called people to follow him, he honored their humanity. His ministry was rooted in presence, walking roads, sharing meals, asking questions, and entering people’s stories with compassion. He did not rush people toward belief; he stayed with them long enough for trust to form. That same pattern is available to every believer, no matter where they live.

In our own neighborhoods, this kind of presence looks like simple, faithful acts: checking in on a neighbor who is lonely, sitting with a coworker who is grieving, or offering a listening ear without trying to fix anything. These small gestures become sacred spaces where the gospel can be seen and felt long before it is spoken. As Fidler reminds us, tea is never really about the tea. It is about time. It is about the willingness to slow down long enough for love to take root.

A key lesson from “1000 Cups of Tea” is that acting with too much urgency can harm relationships. Although our society often values speed, efficiency, and immediate outcomes, even in ministry, Jesus himself was never rushed. He welcomed interruptions, focusing on people rather than productivity. Fidler encourages readers to slow down and practice patience and faithfulness, reminding us that it may take years of consistent kindness before meaningful spiritual conversations happen. The gospel prioritizes faithfulness over efficiency.

Another powerful theme is the value of listening to people’s stories before sharing one’s own beliefs. Even among those who share the same language, culture, or background, individuals may have past hurts and mistrust that influence how they receive new ideas. By approaching others with genuine curiosity instead of correction, asking questions like “Can you tell me your story?”, we allow room for healing and build connections. This mindset opens pathways for meaningful conversations. It’s about learning how to communicate in ways that resonate with your neighbors, friends, and colleagues so your message is truly understood.

Hospitality also plays a central role in this way of living. You don’t need to cross cultures to practice it. Hospitality happens in coffee breaks, shared meals, hospital waiting rooms, long car rides, and quiet moments of sitting with someone who is hurting. Jesus didn’t hand out tracts. He shared tables. Hospitality remains one of the most powerful, overlooked evangelistic practices in Western Christianity.

Ultimately, “1000 Cups of Tea” reminds us that the gospel is relevant and transformative in any language and in any space. It reminds us that the Good News can take root in relationships marked by consistency, integrity, and love without agenda. Paul captures this beautifully when he says, “We were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well.” That is the heart of everyday mission.

Most of us will never cross borders or learn new languages, but all of us can slow down, sit with people, and earn the right to be heard. The gospel moves at the speed of trust. And trust is built one cup of tea at a time.

Everyone, I believe it’s time for tea. Are you ready to share a cup with your friends?
