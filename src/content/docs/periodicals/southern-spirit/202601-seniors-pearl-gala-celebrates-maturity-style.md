# Seniors’ Pearl Gala Celebrates Maturity, Style

Over 100 members and guests of The Salvation Army’s Seniors Program at the Winston-Salem Citadel Corps in North Carolina gathered for a Pearl Gala in late October, wearing their best hats and fanciest strings of pearls. “Pearls age with maturity and endure a lot of adversity to become the precious jewels we cherish,” explains Cassandra Patterson-Brown, who along with Veronica Hasan, coordinated the event. “Everybody has a story, and the hats we wear speak of our diversity.”

The Seniors Program meets twice a week and includes a dizzying schedule of guest speakers, games, exercise, computer skills, line dancing, and Bible study. Field trips have included the farmers’ market, county and state fairs, bowling (a favorite!), and museum visits. All are topped off with a fellowship lunch.

“These great programs enable us to age at home with grace,” declares Dorothy Thomas, describing the mission and ministry of the group to visitors. “We are always on the move!”

Velma Hinton, 97, was recognized for being the oldest member, as well as having attended since the start of the program. Over the years, Velma has given countless volunteer hours for The Salvation Army in Winston-Salem. During the program, she provided a poignant object lesson using everyday cups, making the message meaningful and accessible to all.

The Pearl Gala program was nonstop entertainment and praise to God, with most of the presenters being members themselves. An immense amount of talent was on display, including vocalists, line dancers, and a special group called “Forever a Dancer” who performed a seated, age-inclusive tap dance.

“Our Seniors Program began with just 25 participants,” declares Sergeant Alves Gonzalez, Citadel corps officer, “and we’ve grown to over 80 active members. This is a testament to the program’s meaningful presence in the lives of those we serve.”
