# Cadets Receive Practical Experience Through Spring Campaign and Mission

## Champions of the Mission Take the Gospel to the Streets in Chile

*By: Captains Joshua and Jordan Hinson*

Grab the bass drum, the flag, and a speaker—we are going into the streets! When Territorial Commander Colonel Nesterenko of the South America West Territory shared his vision for Spring Mission 2025, he was very clear: “I want to see your cadets and our cadets joined together, sharing the good news with the people. The people need to see The Salvation Army in the streets again!” That vision came together beautifully as the Southern Territory’s Champions of the Mission session joined cadets from Chile to form small teams paired with local corps to reach people for the Kingdom of God.

Fully trusting with their hope in the Lord, believing God had big plans for their trip, the second-year cadets of the Southern Territory arrived at the Training College in Santiago, Chile. Greeted by welcoming smiles which needed no translation, the cadets met new friends who in a few short days would feel like family. The Champions divided into five teams, laboring each day from around 6:30 a.m. until the Lord brought them home each night.

On the first Sunday, the newly formed teams went to their assigned corps, marching in surrounding neighborhoods with bands, timbrels, and drums, inviting people to come join them. The passion the officers in Chile had for the souls of their neighborhoods was beautiful. God moved in mighty ways that first Sunday, and it was just the beginning of what He had in store.

Throughout the trip, the teams worked to spread the gospel, focusing heavily on outreach and evangelism. Each morning started with united devotions in the chapel of the Training College, during which God poured out His Spirit, giving them just what was needed for the day. Despite language barriers, God moved.

In the **Pudahuel Corps**, the cadets held an Evangelistic Devotions School for 250 children in a school connected to the corps.

The team in the **San Gregorio Corps** had “joy hours” with children from the community and many opportunities for outreach, neighborhood marches, evangelistic meetings, and hospital visitation. They ministered to women in need and watched God at work as some of these women re-dedicated their lives to God throughout the week.

With the **Nueva Extremadura Corps**, cadets engaged in door-to-door ministry, learning the importance of personal connection in sharing faith. They showed how much they cared in each interaction, building relationships and engaging in meaningful conversations.

The group at the **Avenida Matta Corps** helped the corps officer as her husband was in the hospital. They also had a chance to visit a hospital and share kindness and love through soup and prayer.

The final group in the **Lo Valledor Corps** marched, visited people in their homes, sang, and gave testimonies to the goodness of God.

Saturday was a special day, capping off a wonderful week of evangelistic campaigns. The cadets participated in the public welcome of the cadets of the South American West Territory. After spending a week together engaged in ministry, the teams were able to cheer on these cadets they had come to know so well.

As the Champions of the Mission reflect on their time in Chile, here are some of their thoughts about their special time of ministry:

> “God has been so good to us. Before we left Atlanta, we had no idea what God had in store. We were amazed by the officers and cadets we served with. They had fire and passion for the Lord. They were bold, unashamed, and unafraid to share the gospel. We are grateful for each moment, each person, each act of hospitality, and may we never forget the lessons we learned. We went with open hands, and we came back full of God’s blessings. God knew exactly what He was doing, and we came back even more sure of His plan for our lives. The Champions of the Mission of the Southern Territory will be forever changed by the officers, cadets, and people of Chile.”

## Keepers of the Covenant Experience Hands-Hands-On Ministry

*By: Captain Kelsey Bridges*

From the bluebonnets of Texas to the sun-kissed coast of Florida and the history-steeped culture of Alabama, the Southern Territory flung its arms wide to welcome the Keepers of the Covenant session of cadets as they embarked on their Spring Campaign. For ten days, three teams of first-year cadets were immersed in diverse communities across Houston, Texas; Orlando, Florida; and Birmingham, Alabama, joined by their coaching officers from the Evangeline Booth College.

Cadets hit the ground running from the moment they arrived, each team leading holiness meetings in area corps, teaching Sunday school classes, and facilitating corps cadet lessons. They led Spirit-filled worship, preached compelling messages from the Word, and shared testimonies of the wonder-working power of God in their lives. Each congregation extended warm hospitality, embracing the cadets as part of their corps family from day one.

***Team Houston*** had the opportunity to serve in all the area corps and the Adult Rehabilitation Center (ARC). Cadets led worship programs for senior citizens and served practically, preparing food parcels and hygiene kits that were distributed to members of the community facing housing insecurity.

Across their ten days, ***Team Birmingham*** led anointed worship, provided preaching, testimonies, and intercessory prayer. They experienced the inspiring ministry of Birmingham 614’s Reveal ministry which provides a foundational discipleship model that leads to personal transformation. They toured the ARC and the Center of Hope. They led Bible studies in the corps, as well as worship services at area nursing homes. Cadets were called to step outside their comfort zones, joining in street ministry outreach at bus stops where they shared prayer with others and gave testimonies of the hope found in Jesus.

***Team Orlando*** led dynamic worship services, shared in youth ministry, street evangelism, senior ministry programs, and campus beautification projects. They were provided valuable Q&A sessions with volunteer coordinators as well as at the ARC and participated in the Advisory Organization School of Excellence. Cadets also had the honor of attending a reception at an Orlando Advisory Board member’s home, where board members shared what motivated them to serve alongside the Army. The following morning was spent preparing over 1,000 sandwiches to be distributed in the area, leaving cadets amazed and humbled by the spectrum of experiences a Salvation Army officer may see one day to the next.

Cadet Spring Campaigns have been an important and longstanding component of the first-year training framework. The impact their time had on the Keepers of the Covenant was substantial and illuminating, providing them with essential hands-on field learning and exposing them to a variety of innovative ministries taking place across the territory. This experience has given each of them a better understanding and a firmer foundation of knowledge for what to expect when entering their own corps appointments in just over a year.
