# A Legacy of Service, a Lifetime of Love

Richard “Bruce” McCommons dedicated much of his professional life to research in areas such as system safety and human performance for the United States Army. McCommons was well-read, well-educated, and highly productive, including through his extensive work as an author and co-author in the professional space and as a lifelong automobile enthusiast. He was a devoted husband to his wife of 55 years, Jean McCommons, and he was a loving father and grandfather. McCommons also loved The Salvation Army, and he left a quiet, yet powerful and long-lasting impact in Central Maryland.

For decades, McCommons helped support The Salvation Army of Central Maryland through his skills in tax preparation. Instead of asking clients for payment for his tax prep services, he instead asked them to make donations, in their own names, to support the work of The Salvation Army. McCommons never sought recognition for this quiet act of service, but, over the years, he helped raise thousands of dollars through his selflessness. McCommons’ dedication to helping his community through this process continued until he passed away on September 12, 2025, at the age of 82.

“Bruce McCommons embodied the very spirit of philanthropy — not through wealth or recognition, but through selfless service,” says Captain Jeremy Mockabee, area commander for The Salvation Army of Central Maryland. “His creativity in turning his professional gifts into a blessing for others is a legacy we will never forget.”

“Bruce was a man of quiet generosity, steady faith, and remarkable kindness,” says Amy Middleton, major gifts manager for The Salvation Army and McCommons’ direct liaison to the organization. “His life was not about recognition or praise, but about service. About giving back in ways both profound and practical. To me, he was not only an example of philanthropy, but also of what it means to live a life of integrity and purpose.”

Middleton also references a persistent and ever-present conviction in McCommons’ life that he would often share with her. He believed that everyone who has been blessed and can give back should do so in their community.

Others who encountered McCommons shared stories of his steadfast humility and generosity, as well as his belief in what The Salvation Army stands for and its mission of meeting human need in His name without discrimination.

“Bruce lived his life with humility, with quiet strength, and with a generosity that flowed from the heart,” Middleton says. “He leaves behind a legacy of service, but more importantly, he leaves behind an example of love. Love for his family, his community, and his neighbors.”

“May we honor Bruce not just with our words, but by carrying forward the lessons he taught us. To love deeply, to serve faithfully, and to give of ourselves wherever and however we can,” Middleton adds.

While not everyone can follow the same direct pathway that McCommons forged, his contributions serve as a model of how a single person or family can create impactful ripples that flow through an entire community. Poignantly, Jean McCommons and the family suggested after Bruce’s passing that, in lieu of flowers, contributions should be made to The Salvation Army of Central Maryland in Bruce’s memory.

“The Salvation Army of Central Maryland is deeply grateful for Bruce’s decades of support,” Captain Mockabee says. “We will continue to honor his memory by serving our community with the same humility and compassion he demonstrated every day.”
