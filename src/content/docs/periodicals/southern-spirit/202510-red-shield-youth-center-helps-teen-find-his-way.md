“If it wasn’t for this place, I would probably be doing things I have no business doing,” Micah Grier admits.

Micah is a teen student who’s been coming to the Red Shield Youth Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, every summer since he was five years old. He loves playing basketball in the gym, hanging out in the teen room with his friends, and helping around the center when he can. Micah is a respectful young man who now understands how valuable his future is, an idea that wasn’t clear to him when he was younger.

Micah describes his younger self as angry and explosive. He would throw tantrums when he didn’t get his way. Felicia Cohen, the site director for the Charlotte Red Shield Youth Center, remembers his behavior all too well.

“He would blow up out of nowhere,” Felicia recalls. “The smallest things just set Micah off.”

Felicia and her staff would often pull Micah out of group activities to let him calm down. It’s a technique she uses frequently with the students.

“Sometimes they get explosive and can’t control their emotions,” Felicia explains. “Once they calm down, I give them a few minutes to sit in the office. Then I ask, ‘Okay, what happened?’ And then they talk.”

That kind of space was necessary for Micah to express himself, but more importantly, to build his trust with the staff. Over time, Felicia and other staff members became mentors for Micah, supporting him both inside and outside the youth center. They attended his football and basketball games, spent time with him during his lunch period, and were there for him during difficult life events.

“My first year of middle school, a lot had changed in my environment,” Micah says. “But then I realized that I could talk to people about what was going on and what I was going through.” One of the people Micah felt he could talk to was Felicia. During their one-on-one time together, there was one piece of advice she gave that has stayed with him: “You can’t let anything control you.”

Now entering his sophomore year of high school, Micah is a junior staff member and a role model for other children at the center. He helps keep the facility clean by taking out the trash, sweeping, and mopping the floors. He also assists staff members with the younger groups by facilitating games and taking attendance. He takes on additional roles as needed, such as helping with lunch distribution and making copies for activities. Most importantly, he’s having fun and making friends every day.

“When he was younger, I could see him being a leader. He just didn’t know how to show it yet,” Felicia says. “Being in this environment, he had to help others. We told him, ‘Micah, we need you to step up.’ He has leadership skills and putting him in a place to be a leader is what I believe helped him.”

Micah is currently on his high school football team and has a 3.2 grade point average. He has his eyes set on attending his dream school, Florida State University, when he graduates from high school. He is interested in studying information technology and aspires to play in the NFL.

“He’s come a long way, and I’m proud of him,” Felicia beams.

Micah feels proud of himself too, saying he no longer lets his emotions control him. He’s focused on school, protecting his mom and sister, and searching for a part-time job. Most of all, he’s excited for next summer to create more memories at the Red Shield Youth Center.
