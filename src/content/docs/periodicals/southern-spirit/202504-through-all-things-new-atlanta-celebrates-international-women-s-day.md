# Through ‘All Things New’ Atlanta Celebrates International Women’s Day

*Women have played incredibly significant roles — in our world and in The Salvation Army — all throughout history. With the intersection of Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day, the Southern Territory’s Ministry to Women Department set aside a day to celebrate and encourage the women officers and employees across Atlanta on March 5.*

*Women from Territorial Headquarters (THQ), the Evangeline Booth College, Georgia Divisional Headquarters, Metro Atlanta Area Command, area corps, and even from Camp Grandview gathered at the Atlanta Temple Corps for fellowship, encouragement, and to hear biblical teaching on how God makes “All Things New,” the theme and focus of the day.*

*“We are celebrating each one of you today,” Major Anne Westmoreland, territorial ministries to women secretary, said in welcome. “We’re going to worship Jesus this morning, and we’re going to ask Him to show us something new.”*

*The chosen theme scripture was presented, then reinforced through dance and music.* *“See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland”* *(Isaiah 43:19).*

*Following a time of worship, Commissioner Donna Igleheart, territorial president of women’s ministries, spoke a message of life and renewal over those present. She explained that after escaping slavery in Egypt, the ancient Israelites entered a real wilderness, wandering in the desert. “Haven’t we all experienced seasons in our own lives that felt like an exile?”*

*Referring to hardships and difficulties seen and experienced during her time serving in South Africa as well as in her recent trip to support the Army’s ministry in Angola, Commissioner Donna said, “Our circumstances may look very different than the challenges in Angola, but when we are in the middle and mess of it all, we are invited to thank Jesus for the here and now, not the finished product.”*

*“We are tempted to delay our words of gratitude until conditions improve,” she continued. “Trust that God is at work in both the ugly and the beautiful.”*

*God is good through it all, even in the desert. “This is the heart of Isaiah 43:19 — God showing up in the wilderness, God being present in the wasteland, God making a way where there seems to be no way.”*

*Special guest speaker Barb Roose then began a series of sessions on “Miracles in the Wilderness.”*

*“Each and every one of us goes through these wilderness seasons in life, and one of the most difficult parts of those hard seasons is this sense that we are alone,” Barb said. “But today, I want to talk with you about how you can be assured that God is with you.”*

*Explaining that the spirit of fear cannot keep us where God has already freed us, Barb continued, “Our hope is in the with-ness of God, when we are reminded that He is ever-present.”*

*She then spoke about the Israelites’ tendency to complain in the wilderness. “The wilderness may feel like a punishment, but actually the wilderness gives us a front-row seat to God’s provision and faithfulness.”*

*“When we take our eyes off of what is happening around us, when we raise them up, we will be able to see the glory of the Lord… and we are reminded that God takes care of His children at all times,” she continued. “Seeing God’s miracles in the wilderness begins with prayer because prayer is the opposite of complaining.”*

*Encouraging the women to “forget the former things,” Barb said, “When we are in the wilderness journey…some of what makes it difficult for us to move forward is what we’re holding onto. That is keeping us back.”*

*“Surrender is the only path to experience Jesus’ peace,” she said. “Surrender is a survival technique when all control is lost. Surrender is giving over control. In a spiritual sense, it’s giving over what you cannot control to the God who is in control.”*

*When experiencing a wilderness season, we need to learn to pray, “God, I can’t. But you can. And I will let you.”*

*Their time together concluded with a lunch session where Barb explained the importance of taking care of ourselves. Self-care can be seen as a spiritual discipline because our bodies were created by a spiritual God. “Your beauty is because you are a reflection and a creation of God,” Barb affirmed.*

*Concluding their time together, THQ employee Flo Knox thanked Barb for her messages of truth and love and prayed blessings over her continued ministry. In addition to everything they learned throughout the day, the women left with a Bible study book Barb wrote on the Gospel of Matthew and a gift of flower bulbs that will blossom in tandem with the hearts of all who were blessed by their beautiful time together.*
