# Shelter Staff Save a Life in Austin, Texas

Several staff members of The Salvation Army Austin Shelter for Women and Children are being recognized for their significant roles in saving the life of an infant in their facility.

Early one morning in June, a nine-year-old boy in the shelter ran to the front desk saying that his four-month-old sister wasn’t breathing. Shelter Monitors Jacqueline Hillard and Lisa Crawford, monitoring the front desk at the time, instantly responded. Hillard told Crawford to call 911 while she ran to assist.

When Hillard arrived on the scene, a shelter resident was already administering CPR to the infant. After assessing the situation and finding the infant had no pulse, Hillard took over administering CPR until the infant began breathing on her own. Austin emergency services arrived just a few minutes later, and the infant and her family were transported to a nearby children’s hospital.

The infant’s mother informed the shelter that the hospital found the health emergency to be a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) and released them later that day.

Austin Area Command celebrated all the local heroes involved in saving the life of this little girl, presenting them with certificates which read:

> “In recognition of your extraordinary courage, quick thinking, and critical role in the emergency response that helped save the life of an infant in distress. Your selfless response and calmness under pressure embody the highest values of The Salvation Army: compassion, service, and unwavering commitment to those in need.
>
> “Your heroic actions not only saved a life but also inspired all who serve alongside you. We are proud to honor your bravery and dedication.”

Thank you to the employees of the Austin Shelter for Women and Children for your quick response, and for being the hands and feet of Jesus to those in your care. And thank you to all the incredible men and women who serve on the front lines of our Salvation Army. Your preparation and dedication not only minister to the souls of those in need, but in some instances literally save lives.
