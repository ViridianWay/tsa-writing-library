# Angel Tree in Romania Successful Thanks to Generous International and Local Partnerships

The Angel Tree program in Romania had a successful and generous 2024 Christmas season. A mixture of villages, schools, churches, and families in Bucharest were among those gifted with an exciting Christmas morning thanks to the Angel Tree program. This portion of the division’s efforts was supported by American troops who volunteered and sponsored angels, along with international and local community businesses and individual sponsors. 

Romania Divisional Commander Major Ionel Sandu tells us, “Angel Tree started with 100 angels six years ago with the help of the Mihail Kogălniceanu Air Base with American soldiers and now has grown to over 1500 angels annually around all Romania.” 

> From the Mihail Kogălniceanu Air Base Religious Affairs Office, Major Wade Shepard, Chaplain, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division says, “This is something bigger than us that we are giving back to. We have faith that we are joining others and people that we don’t even know to help put a smile on their face.”

With this ongoing partnership, the positive morale for the troops stationed abroad and the cultural bridging between both countries makes this partnership so unique and valuable. 

The dramatic increase in distribution, not only in Constanta County where the Air Base partners with The Salvation Army for regular community projects, but all over Romania, is largely in thanks to local donors and both private and public partners of The Salvation Army who have seen the need and have stepped in to make a difference in the lives of children all over Romania. 

“From season to season, donors want to get involved locally too in each community we serve,” Major Sandu continues. The Angel Tree program “has grown the visibility of The Salvation Army’s work here in Romania to local communities,” blessing thousands of families along the way.
