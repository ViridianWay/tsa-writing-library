# A Kingdom-Centric Mindset

The work of the Kingdom of God is LIFE! God is passionate about bringing life to its fullest expression in His world. Soldiers and disciples can and should reflect the blessings and the life of God onto others. How can we ensure that we intentionally practice this in our corps and in our own lives every day?

In April, leaders and soldiers of the Kentucky- Tennessee Division from Knoxville Citadel, Sevierville Corps, Maryville Corps, Chattanooga Citadel, Nashville Berry Street Corps, Kingsport Corps, and Richardson Corps convened at the Knoxville Area Command for a first-of-its-kind retreat with special guest speaker and instructor Dr. Reggie McNeal, to discuss how to shift the mindset of our corps from “church-centric” to “Kingdom-centric.” Held in conjunction with the Territorial Mission, Evangelism & Cultural Ministries Department, the attending corps were challenged and stretched by the questions and discussions presented.

*“How do we make viral Kingdom agents?”* As the Southern Territory focuses on service this year, we want to make soldiers and disciples who are serving their neighbors and communities, not just attending or running corps programs. John Wesley knew this secret: that discipleship occurs in the midst of doing the mission, especially when we do it together.

*“Our goal is not to get people plugged in; it is to send people out!”* Getting our people deployed to go out and disciple, to go out and serve, to go out and bless, is not just an activity we can do — it is the **vital effort** of discipleship.

*“Our conversation rate has to go up before our conversion rate goes up!”* Engaging in relationship with those around us helps more people become disciples of Jesus.

*“What has God told you/us to do? What are you doing about it?”* Let’s move from a curriculum- based discipleship approach to an obedience- based mission to fulfill our commission to make disciples in our everyday lives.

*“How should we keep score? How do we know if we are doing well?”* Each corps worked on a scorecard that reflected their values and mission. Do those scorecards just show our busyness, or do they reveal the changes we hope to see as the Kingdom of God comes? Let’s learn what to look for and how to measure signs of a fuller life and celebrate when we see it. Let’s learn to observe, record, and acknowledge the positive changes we see in our people or in our communities as the Spirit is moving. Then we can see the specific effects of being salt and light in the community and know we are fulfilling our mission. And we can celebrate the King’s movement amongst us!

Dr. Reggie McNeal, author of “Kingdom Come” and other books on the Church’s Kingdom mission, welcomed participants, saying, “We have come together to discuss how to accelerate your service with God in His Kingdom work.” Kingdom is about life as it is intended — the abundant life! Jesus didn’t come just to show us the Kingdom; He came to live the Kingdom with His people. And He invites Salvationists to live with Him and join His mission in everyday life. A Kingdom-centric corps and a Kingdom-centric soldier means, “the people of God partnering with Jesus in His redemptive mission out in the world.”

Following the retreat, Sergeant Jeff Clarke, Knoxville Corps administrator, shared, “The retreat gave our corps practical actions that we are using which benefit our corps and command. We are more engaged through prayer walks, more clearly focused on reaching out, more engaged in telling others the story of God’s work in our lives, and in praying for the folks in our neighborhood — and getting out there too!”
