# Women Celebrate Togetherness at Chattanooga and Knoxville Regional Rally

*In late March, something truly special unfolded at the Chattanooga Citadel Corps as women from across the region joined together for the 2025 Regional Women’s Rally, themed “All Things New.”*

From the moment the first car pulled into the parking lot, there was a palpable sense of excitement and expectation. Ladies from Cleveland, Knoxville, Maryville, Sevierville, and all across the Chattanooga area gathered not just for a program, but for a shared experience of community, renewal, and joy. 

One of the most powerful aspects of the day was simply being together. In a world that often keeps us moving in a million different directions, the opportunity to pause and connect with sisters in Christ from other communities was a gift in itself. The rally created space to strengthen bonds between corps, rekindle old friendships, and spark new connections. 

From the moment attendees stepped through the doors, they were greeted by gorgeous decorations—floral touches, spring-themed colors, and intentional design that reflected the theme of “new beginnings.” The effort by the Chattanooga and Knoxville Area Commands and local corps officers to create a beautiful and welcoming environment did not go unnoticed. It wasn’t just an event—it felt like a celebration. 

The Spirit-filled leadership of Chase and Morgan Teachey, Kentucky-Tennessee’s divisional music leaders, brought the room to life with songs that stirred the heart and prompted voices lifted in praise. Whether it was quiet reflection or loud celebration, the music was a vital part of the day’s journey. 

Major Karen Egan, divisional women’s ministries secretary from Louisville, blessed the event with her warm presence and encouragement, reminding those present of the strength we find when we stand together. Special guest speaker Teresa Norman’s authenticity, kindness, and passion for the Lord brought a sense of grace to the day. And Major Storm McClure and Major Paula Henderson’s leadership, planning, and pastoral hearts created a space where women could feel seen, known, and loved. 

This kind of regional connection is vital. It reminds us that we’re not in ministry or life alone—we’re part of a broader, beautifully diverse sisterhood that uplifts and supports one another. Through shared worship, shared laughter, and even shared meals, the Lord knitted hearts together in fresh and meaningful ways. 

In a season where many are hungry for connection, this Regional Women’s Rally delivered. It wasn’t just a program—it was a movement of hope, a picture of unity, and a joyful glimpse into the new things God is doing across our region. As the event wrapped up, every participant went home with a gift—a tangible reminder of the new thing God is doing in their lives. But more importantly, they left with full hearts, inspired faith, and the encouragement of knowing they are part of something bigger.
