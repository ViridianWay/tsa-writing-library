# Music Sunday — A Special Time of Spiritual Growth

The Salvation Army observes many special Sundays throughout the year, such as National Women Preach Sunday, emphasizing women's leadership in ministry, and Covenant Sunday, a day for committing the year to God and strengthening the relationship with Him. Other special Sundays include Candidates Sunday, celebrating those called to officership, and Volunteer Sunday, recognizing the contributions of those who serve. These designated Sundays offer unique opportunities for worship, spiritual growth, and supporting various ministries through prayer and offerings. 

September 14, 2025, was one such Sunday for the congregation at Prince George’s Corps in Hyattsville, Maryland. Each year, **Music Sunday** brings a chance for the congregation to experience and celebrate the diverse talents of the church community in a meaningful way. This year the corps had the pleasure of welcoming special guests **Dr. Jamie Hood**, his wife **Wendy**, and their children, **Pearson and Nicole**. 

The Hoods actively participate in the Atlanta Temple music forces, but for this occasion, they brought their talents and spiritual gifts to lead worship at Prince George’s Corps. They prepared solos and duets, selected the music for the entire morning, and showed up ready to worship and guide the congregation through God’s Word and their response to it. As they joined in with the small corps ensemble, the additional players (and volume!) increased the energy in the chapel, setting the tone for the service.

After Corps Administrator Sergeant John McKee introduced and welcomed the guests, Wendy and Nicole led the congregation in a Southern Gospel-style rendition of the beloved song **“I’ll Fly Away.”** Not simply a nod to traditional lyrics and music, this well-known song had the entire congregation smiling and singing at full volume.

As the congregation settled back into their seats, Dr. Jamie and Pearson played Peter Graham’s well-known cornet duet **“Quicksilver.”** The two cornets played interweaving melody lines, creating a sense of dialogue between father and son, showcasing their technical abilities and precision in keeping up with the challenging rhythms of the piano accompaniment provided by Stephen Bulla.

Following the beautiful duet, Wendy gave her testimony of God’s continuing faithfulness in good times as well as difficult ones.

Nicole then showed a depth of musicianship beyond her years in her vocal solo **“Nothing But Thy Blood”** by Donna Peterson, arranged by Simon Gash. Accompanied by her mother on piano, Nicole demonstrated an instinctive and impressive understanding of the musicality of the song and in the depths of the words themselves as she turned the musical phrases with an effortless and introspective style.

The corps brass band then played **“Ave Verum Corpus”** (Love Divine) as the offertory. This arrangement of Mozart’s famous motet by Stephen Bulla allowed the group to continue to actively worship through their playing by providing a moment of peaceful reflection and a reminder of the enduring power of music to express deep spirituality.

Next on the program was Pearson performing flugelhorn solo **“Visions of Slane”** by Stephen Bulla, the latter accompanying Pearson on the piano. The foundation of this piece is the hymn tune **“Slane,”** an Irish folk melody that is also the basis for the well-known hymn "Be Thou My Vision." Pearson’s performance was at once soulful and deeply moving. Of special note, this edition of the solo was commissioned by Dr. Hood and performed by him during his Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) Recital in 2020.

Pearson’s solo had the members of the congregation already reflective and open to receiving the Word of God, brought by Dr. Hood. Focusing on 1 Corinthians 12:12-31, he spoke about how the Apostle Paul uses the metaphor of a human body to illustrate the Church's unity, composed of many different parts (members) that form one cohesive whole. No part can take the place of another, nor can any part take on the purpose or responsibility of another. And so it is with the body of believers; we all have our singular purpose that fits together to make the whole body stronger and perfectly designated in purpose.

Dr. Hood emphasized that every believer, regardless of their spiritual gift or social status, is vital to the body's function and health, united by baptism into one Spirit. He urged the congregation to recognize their mutual interdependence, value the unique role of each member, and to use their gifts to build up the body, all while ultimately striving to emulate Christ’s love. 

Wendy and Nicole then sang **“Make Us One, Lord,”** a prayer for Christian unity inspired by Jesus’ prayer in John 17. Nicole led the congregation in the chorus as Wendy invited the members of the congregation to come to the front of the church and make a new or renewed spiritual commitment to Jesus Christ. It was, as it always is, beautiful to see people make a physical and public response to the gospel message by seeking prayer, confessing faith, and expressing a desire to follow Christ. 

The service concluded with a good old-fashioned, yet still applicable, Salvation Army fight song, **“I’ll Go in the Strength,”** a call to action to continue waging a spiritual war against evil and to win souls for Christ. Following the benediction, the brass ensemble concluded with Bulla’s vibrant and uplifting setting of the familiar patriotic song, **“The Battle Hymn of the Republic,”** as the perfect ending to our Music Sunday!

The Prince George’s Corps was deeply blessed by the ministry of the Hood Family, their thoughtful preparation and skillful utilization of their talents providing a moving and memorable Music Sunday. We look forward to seeing how the Lord will continue to bless and use the Hood family, the Prince George’s Corps, The Salvation Army, and the worldwide body of Christ’s believers for His mission and His glory!
