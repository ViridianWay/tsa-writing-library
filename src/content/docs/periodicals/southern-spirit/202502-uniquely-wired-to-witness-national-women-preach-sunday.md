# Uniquely Wired to Witness: National Women Preach Sunday

On Sunday, March 2, women will take to their church pulpits to preach the gospel across the United States for National Women Preach Sunday. Commissioner Donna Igleheart, territorial president of women’s ministries, and Major Anne Westmoreland, territorial ministries to women secretary, share with us why this Sunday is so important and significant, especially for The Salvation Army.

“The goal of this special Sunday is to have as many women preaching as possible around the nation,” Major Westmoreland shares. “In The Salvation Army, we have many women preaching every Sunday, so this is not anything out of the ordinary, however, bringing special emphasis to women preaching celebrates our heritage and provides a witness to the wider church and communities around us.”

“It is a wonderful opportunity and sacred privilege to share the word of God,” Commissioner Igleheart adds. “The National Preach Sunday reinforces The Salvation Army’s strong commitment to value our women as ordained officers while creating greater visibility and impact. Seeing women in every pulpit encourages and inspires other women and girls who envision themselves in leadership ministry.”

While some churches and denominations hold beliefs that disallow women in leadership and preaching roles, The Salvation Army takes a strong stance in the opposite direction. When William and Catherine Booth founded the Army in 1865, both took equally active roles in leading and preaching.

“From the Army’s beginning equal rank was emphasized,” Commissioner Igleheart shares. “There has been a distinctive historical record regarding women in preaching positions. Catherine Booth set a strong precedent by taking the pulpit by storm and advocating for women’s rights to preach.” Catherine was an incredible preacher, setting an example for generations to come of what it can look like to be a wife and mother as well as an effective leader and preacher.

In the book “Heart Messages,” Emma Booth-Tucker, one of William and Catherine’s children, says of her mother: “Perhaps that was what lent such special pungency to my mother’s sermons, gave them such an atmosphere of sanctified common sense, that they were not manufactured in the seclusion of a library, but dotted down, within the limits of a narrow pocket- book, with a babe at her bosom, or in the midst of heavy household duties, for there were eight children to care and provide for.”

Emma also recalls, “Her vehement denunciations of wrongdoing still ring in my ears, her bold advocacy of the right, her championship of the oppressed, her zeal for the cause, her beautiful self-forgetfulness, her transparent simplicity, her invincible courage — all, all are written as with an iron pen in the rock of my memory forever.”

“Women bring a different perspective and experience that enrich biblical interpretation,” says Commissioner Igleheart. “Women often have the experience of balancing family and ministry. Catherine Booth profoundly said, ‘If we are to better the future, we must disturb the present. When you say a woman cannot preach, you chain the Word of God.’”

“As women leaders and officers in The Salvation Army we have a responsibility to preach,” Major Westmoreland asserts. “There are those in our congregations who need to hear from us. God has given us a message to share and wired us uniquely to share it.

“Our responsibility is also to the next generations who look to us as role models and imagine what they can become. They are watching us, learning from us, and we owe them the best possible testimony.”

The Southern Territory is intentional about empowering and supporting women officers and leaders. Commissioner Igleheart shares that during decision-making, “women officers are being appointed on their own merits and the need of the territory.”

As one of the facets of the current Territorial Priorities, the Southern Territory puts great emphasis on leadership development. To that end, the territory held their first Territorial Women Officers Retreat in January as an intentional investment in women’s leadership.

To continue this support of women officers, the Ministry to Women Department is also planning a preaching seminar for women September 10-12, 2025, focusing on encouraging and equipping women leaders.

“We have an incredible heritage and opportunity as women Salvationists,” says Major Westmoreland. “It is a privilege to link arms and work on furthering the mission together.”

“Women officers have the unique opportunity to serve as role models of faith, resilience, and serving while cultivating a firm foundation for our daughters of the next generation to stand upon,” Commissioner Igleheart continues. “Women officers are essential in shaping our Army’s continued impact on the world. Someone paved the way for us, and now it is time to rise up and take our place in the gospel story.”

Thank you, women officers of The Salvation Army. Thank you for standing tall, speaking boldly, preaching honestly, and leading effectively. Our Army is better for your leadership.
