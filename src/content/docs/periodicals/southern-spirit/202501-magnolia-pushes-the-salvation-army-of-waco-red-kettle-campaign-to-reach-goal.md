# Magnolia Pushes The Salvation Army of Waco Red Kettle Campaign To Reach Goal

Pocket change adds up, which is why The Salvation Army’s annual Red Kettle Campaign has raised $3 billion since 1997. But sometimes the cause needs help from even deeper pockets. Enter Chip and Joanna Gaines. 

The power couple and Magnolia founders pledged $50,000 toward the 2024 campaign, ensuring it reaches its $185,000 goal, Major Jeffrey Miracle announced. Without the donation, which matched what the Gaines gave in 2023, The Salvation Army of Waco would have fallen about $50,000 short. 

Major Miracle said it was no surprise the Red Kettle Campaign locally faced a shortfall as the deadline approached. Inflation and a shortened holiday season had families pinching pennies, but Magnolia’s support helped fill the gap. 

“Thanks to the generous support of Magnolia, The Salvation Army of Waco expects to reach our Red Kettle goal of $185,000 by the end of the day on Christmas Eve,” Major Miracle said in a press release. 

The Salvation Army relies heavily on gifts to carry out its mission. Major Miracle said locals show their generosity, but guessed the $50,000 from Magnolia reflects the largest donation this year to support day-to-day operations. The local office budgets $6 million to serve Waco and McLennan County. 

“At Magnolia, we believe that home begins with community, and Waco is at the heart of ours,” a company official said in the press release. “The Salvation Army’s dedication to supporting our neighbors in need reflects the very values that make our city special. We are proud to stand alongside them in their mission to uplift our community by hosting the Red Kettle campaign at the Silos and contributing to their important work.” 

Major Miracle, who arrived in June to lead The Salvation Army in Waco, said he has not met Chip and Joanna Gaines, but would be honored to. “I would love to thank them for what they’ve done.” 

Money raised locally goes to meet needs locally, Major Miracle said. At its 7,000 centers of operation around the country, The Salvation Army provides food for the hungry, emergency relief for disaster survivors, rehabilitation for people suffering from drug and alcohol abuse, and clothing and shelter. 

Locally, The Salvation Army of Waco is moving and, it hopes, getting better. It has announced plans to create a new campus on La Salle Avenue that will feature a Center of Hope, a church building also housing administrative offices, and a larger shelter. Major Miracle said beyond new construction, The Salvation Army hopes to expand services to include day classes and life skills courses. He said college-level coursework is not out of the question. 

Major Miracle said all but $8 million has been raised or committed for the $21 million project, and a renewed fundraising push will start after January 1, 2025.
