# ‘Yesterday, at the Kettle'

Below is a dramatic reading adapted from testimonies of Keepers of the Covenant session of cadets.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** the day was long, but there was hope.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** I got to experience what being where God wants me to be really means.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** there was a chill in the air and a whole lot of laughter, there was music, dancing, and wonder… God was there; Emmanuel, God with us. Yesterday at the kettle. Yesterday at the kettle, a little boy about six years old came up with one hand full of change and the other full of dollar bills. He asked what the money was for. I explained that it helps people in his community, maybe even someone he knows. I guess he liked my answer because he smiled big and stuffed both handfuls of money into the kettle and ran back to his mom.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** a lady checked her purse and said, “I only have twenties.” I told her, that’s okay we don’t discriminate; we take twenties too. She laughed and I laughed, even though it wasn’t a joke. On the way out, she dropped a twenty in the kettle.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** a little boy ran up with a dollar. He asked why I was ringing the bell, and I told him I was ringing the bell for Jesus. He said, “I love Jesus!” So, I let him ring my bell. He was a natural. Be on the lookout for Hector, future cadet bellringer.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** I had the opportunity to pray with a lady dealing with loneliness due to an unhealed relationship with her daughter. I prayed peace over her life, and in that moment we both found peace through the storms and chaos of life. God reminded me that peace comes only through Christ. Thank you, Lord, for peace.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** a lady came towards me, excited to tell me how much she loves The Salvation Army. Then she told me that she used to work at the Atlanta Kroc years ago. She had the best moments there. She couldn’t believe it when I said I lived right next door. She was thrilled and so happy to reconnect with the Army.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** a lady wanted to get change for a five. Then she came back and said she didn’t need the change. She also said that when she passes, she is leaving the Army a bunch of money in her will. I told her I can’t wait! Just kidding; I told her thank you.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** a man named Paul came up and told me December is not the real birth month of Jesus. With a smile, I shared that I am thankful to celebrate the birth of Christ at any point on the calendar. He asked if I knew why Jesus came to earth, and I shared the gospel. He smiled and went into the store. When he came out, he put a couple of dollars in the kettle. He dropped his grocery bag and explained he was getting old and losing feeling in his hands. I asked if we could pray right now, and he agreed. When we were done, I saw tears running down his face, and to both of our surprise, we were not alone. Maria, a new Christian and a visitor from Europe, joined us. She had given her life to Christ two months before and was so happy to see two Christians praying in public. Maria is going to join Paul at church next Sunday. God is so good.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** two different gentlemen approached me and said the same thing: “The Salvation Army saved my life.” One has been sober for 23 years since graduating from the ARC (Adult Rehabilitation Center), and the other is a successful doctor who often attends programs at his local corps.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** a man stared at my sign for what felt like ten minutes. Many thoughts ran through my mind, but my main thought was what I would do if things went south. But the man started to cry and say how much the Army had helped him. Throughout his life, when he needed the Army, they were always there. He said his mom survived two strokes, and he told me how hard things had been. I gave him words of encouragement and prayed with him. I am grateful we could help him again today when he needed it.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** I met an older lady who stopped briefly to talk to me because she was from North Carolina and had heard about our disaster work there. I was able to tell her I had been there myself. This brought tears to her eyes. We talked a lot about the area, and I was able to tell her about how hard the communities were working, and that God was faithful and blessing the people in beautiful ways. She said I was an answer to her prayers and cried there at the kettle. She wants me to thank all of you for what you do. Thank you.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** a man came with a little bit of change to put in my bucket. Almost tearing up he said, “The Salvation Army has always given me clothes when I need it. I know this is not much.” I told him, “Thank you” as I held back tears.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** a small Jewish man came running up with cash in hand. He was excited to donate and said that The Salvation Army saved his friend’s family during the Holocaust. And if it had not been for the Army, his friend’s lineage and family would not exist right now.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** I met a gentleman who shared that when his dad was sent to serve in World War II, The Salvation Army was the only one who made sure their family had Christmas. This is why he gives and volunteers every year.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** there was blood and fire. While I was ringing, a couple come up, and the man said he had been a junior soldier and was thankful to see someone in uniform. He put some money in and proceeded to say, “Blood and Fire, sister, Blood and Fire!” I was so encouraged.

**Yesterday, at the kettle,** there was a reason to give God the glory. There was wonder and joy. There was a light in the darkness. Because of Jesus, there was bright hope for tomorrow. Emmanuel. God With Us. There were 386 shared days at the kettle for the Keepers of the Covenant, and the hope of Christ was shared and received on each one. $113,356.46 was raised for the work of The Salvation Army in Atlanta by the Keepers of the Covenant, all done through the love of God that inspires us to go out and love others.

**Yesterday, at the kettle…**
