# Potomac Represents the South at Rose Bowl Parade

On January 1, countless people lined the streets of Pasadena, California to witness the 137th Tournament of Roses Parade. In the center of it all was The Salvation Army, participating as the longest-running consecutive marching band in the parade, appearing each year since 1920. The group is composed of more than 200 Salvationists, including a special guest ensemble as the “duty” band each year. For 2026, that group was the Potomac Brass and Divisional Creative Arts Ensemble, representing the USA Southern Territory.

The delegation of more than 45 young people and leaders arrived in California on December 26 and spent most of the first two days in rehearsal and preparation. The band and creative artists stayed alongside other Salvationist guests at the Lawrence M. Daley Camp and Conference Center, fostering opportunity for fruitful fellowship.

“I think many of the young people from other divisions and the other territories were motivated or even inspired by our band,” says David Delaney, Potomac Divisional music director and the bandmaster of Potomac Brass. “A number of people came up to me and couldn’t believe the age range we had and how varied the ministry is. I think that’s something you don’t see too often outside of Salvation Army groups. It’s something that’s pretty neat about our ministry.”

Beginning on Sunday, December 28, the group faced several long days with an exhausting pace but fulfilling ministry opportunities. Sunday featured a visit to the Pasadena Tabernacle Corps for Sunday morning worship followed by a New Year’s concert at the Tustin Ranch Corps. December 29 centered around “Bandfest” at Pasadena City College, as The Salvation Army’s group joined with other marching bands from around the world playing in front of a packed stadium. Disneyland was the centerpiece of December 30, as the band marched down the park’s “Main Street” in open-air fashion before a day of memorable fun and fellowship. December 31 began with a marching rehearsal alongside the rest of The Salvation Army’s delegation, followed by an evening program at the camp. Potomac’s young people led the events, including a rendition of “Auld Lang Syne,” games, fun, food and beverages, and a lot of laughter.

The centerpiece of the trip arrived on January 1 with the parade. This featured an early morning trip to Pasadena, followed by a lineup and a nearly six-mile parade route. Widespread rain showers added a new level of difficulty to the already challenging day, Delaney sharing that it “made things even more memorable.”

“Our group had a great attitude through the entire thing,” Delaney says of the conditions. “They did a good job, in spite of being soaking wet.”

> “There were moments on this trip, especially during the parade, when I truly didn’t think I would make it to the end,” says Makayla White of the Richmond Citadel (Virginia) Corps. “When we hit the halfway mark during the parade, I remember praying and asking God to help me see it through, relying on Him for strength and energy instead of my own. Finishing the parade showed me that I can finish what I start when I trust God rather than relying on my own strength.”

While the rain persisted for much of the route, the Potomac Divisional groups represented The Salvation Army and the Kingdom well, and Delaney shares that “the end of the parade was really beautiful.”

“The rain let up and there was a nice kind of fog or mist over the mountains,” Delaney continues. “As we were coming through the tunnel, it was really cool and striking. And then, of course, everyone was able to eat their In-N-Out burgers, so everybody was happy.”

The parade, and the overall journey, was unforgettable, and for many participants, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

> “Going to the Rose Bowl with the band was such an amazing reminder of God’s faithfulness,” says Jasmine Archila of the Fredericksburg (Virginia) Corps. “Even with all the rain, I could feel Him guiding us through every rehearsal, performance, and bit of travel. Getting to worship Him through music and share all of it with my friends made me realize how lucky I am to serve Him alongside people I care about. This trip was such a blessing, bringing me closer to God while making memories I’ll never forget.”

With a special hat-tip to The Salvation Army’s Western Territorial music leadership, including Neil Smith and Evan Figueras, Delaney expressed the overarching gratitude felt by the band and its leaders. High school seniors in the band were charged with giving vespers each evening, and they stepped up to ensure that Jesus Christ was at the center of every moment of the trip. Young people in the band were also challenged, before ever stepping foot on a plane, to aid in the fundraising for the journey, and that instilled another element of investment that helped to enhance the impact.

“This kind of trip is also a great benefit to the soldiers in our own division,” Delaney says. “It deepens the connections they have with like-minded believers… These bonds turn into lifelong friendships, continuing to lift each other up, edify each other and sharpen each other in the future.”

“I saw those bonds forming over and over in California. It’s more than just having a good time. It’s having real talks with each other. Calling each other out when needed. Building each other up. It’s been a great example of how the Body of Christ is supposed to live in community with each other, doing God’s work with each other.”
