# SERVE: Building Project Revs Up Camp Walter Johnson

Members of the Hendersonville and Fayetteville chapters of the Sons of the Savior Motorcycle Ministry (SSMM) recently completed their first of two building projects at Camp Walter Johnson (CWJ) in the North & South Carolina Division. The volunteer man (and woman) hours spanned several months through both winter and spring to add a deck to the existing Field House—just in time for the division’s Men’s Camp.

“This is a great addition to accommodate our campers, young and old,” says Shea Simms, the camp’s caretaker. “Lowe’s donated the original building several years ago, and it’s designed to house a canteen for the campers while they are out here on the ballfield. Before, they had to go way across camp to the main canteen for snacks and cold drinks. This is great for everyone!”

While a “wish list” of several renovations and additions at CWJ are possible over the next few years, the Field House deck had priority.

“Our next project will be at the old Firehouse,” reports SSMM co-founder and president, Roy Snelson. “We plan to gut the entire interior and convert it into a coffee house. It should be extremely popular with campers and staff who enjoy their cappuccinos and espressos, along with pastries. It will be a wonderful place for folks to just hang out.”

Several of the SSMM members selflessly gave a week’s vacation and/or several weekends to make this service project a reality.
