# A Hand-Crafted Christmas

The Kanawha Valley Woodworkers are utilizing their talents and skills to craft joy this Christmas season. Part of the group’s annual holiday project includes making handmade wooden toys for distribution through The Salvation Army’s Angel Tree program for Charleston Area Command, serving families in seven counties across southern West Virginia.

The sound of holiday joy could not be ignored as Salvation Army Area Commanders Captains Mike and Cathy Michels visited the woodworkers, observing the early stages of the production process. The busy workshop was filled with Kanawha Valley Woodworker members cutting, sanding, and assembling cradles, block wagons, and toy cars. While the smell of sawdust and wood glue may not be the traditional scent of the Christmas season, the spirit of giving filled the shop, reminiscent of elves busily working away to provide joy for children on Christmas morning.

The woodworkers were excited to see the captains, happily sharing their stories, explaining how long they had been crafting cradles or how they had fashioned a template for the wagons to ensure that each one is identical.

“This work changes lives,” Captain Cathy Michels declared, watching a cradle take shape. “Every cut and brushstroke carries care and love to make a child’s Christmas magical.”

The group donates hundreds of toys each year, spending over 900 volunteer hours crafting just the cradles alone. From the first cut of the wood to the final coat of paint, each toy is handmade with care and meticulous attention to detail. By the time Christmas arrives, these cradles, wagons, and toy cars will find their way into the homes of children who might not otherwise have a gift under their tree this Christmas.

Captain Mike Michels remarked that this effort beautifully reflects the heart of The Salvation Army’s mission. “These volunteers are giving their time and skill to bring joy to children they’ll probably never meet,” he continued. “That’s the true spirit of the season.”

The partnership between the Kanawha Valley Woodworkers and The Salvation Army has been a long-standing local tradition for over 40 years. Their efforts provide hundreds of handcrafted gifts for families in the region each Christmas, ensuring that every child has a magical Christmas morning.
