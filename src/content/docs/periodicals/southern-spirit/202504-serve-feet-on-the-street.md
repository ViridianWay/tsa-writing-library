# SERVE: 'Feet on the Street'

The Great Commission, found in Matthew 28, centers on a command from Jesus Christ to all believers to “go and make disciples.” With that as the inspiration and backdrop, the Southern Territorial Mission, Evangelism & Cultural Ministries Department is re-releasing an evangelistic outreach ministry resource, titled “Feet on the Street.” The recently revised resource, originally written by Major Bette Jo McDonald and circulated in 2006, challenges local Salvation Army units to establish a three-year mission plan with the express focus of fulfilling the Great Commission.

“There’s something really important about being with your fellow believers, and I think that is what we’re trying to accomplish through ‘Feet on the Street,’” says Major Lynda Thornhill, territorial mission, evangelism, and cultural ministries secretary. “Our existing church base getting together and expanding. We have to do that, putting our literal feet on the street, taking the title and going with the mission that we take from Jesus to ‘go and make disciples.’”

“We can’t only do that inside our building,” Major Thornhill continues. “We have to see what that looks like on the outside, and this resource has practical steps on what we can do as soldiers and officers to get outside of our comfort zone, lay our fears aside, and become the feet of Jesus.”

The resource focuses on a seven-step process that is both comprehensive and adaptable. This begins with the purposeful development of contacts within the community.

“The Salvation Army is unique in that other churches often have to go out and find their harvest field,” Major Thornhill says. “We have the harvest coming to us sometimes through our social services work and programs. Why would we not take that opportunity to reach out to people who we already serve? Why not invite our food pantry recipients or our Angel Tree program participants? It’s not just a one-time contact.”

“Feet on the Street” then suggests that a plan proceeds through a dedicated process of outreach. This can include local gatherings with pre-planned audiences, as well as chance meetings in everyday life.

“It can be at the grocery store. It can be at the gas station, or at a kid’s softball game. It’s about getting past our fears of what people might think of us if we invite them to church,” says Major Thornhill. “In my experience and in our research, most people that come to church come because they were invited. Not necessarily because they were handed something or saw something, but because someone invited them. We need to do that and be better about inviting people to church.”

Follow-up is also a key part of the process that is often overlooked. Once the initial contact is made, the work is not done. Major Thornhill notes that “continual contact is crucial,” and outlines that The Salvation Army expressly “wants people to feel welcome and have a place so that they can become part of the outreach.”

While it is undeniable that different individuals bring different strengths, weaknesses, and overall mindsets to the outreach process, “Feet on the Street” endeavors to ease the burden of getting started or simply knowing what to do to initiate connections. For example, the resource includes a sample letter that can be used as is or can be tailored to a specific community or ministry.

“Feet on the Street” is not designed to be revolutionary, but simple and effective in helping officers and soldiers alike to reach out to others with an eye toward discipleship.

“All of us are people of good intentions, but we need to make those intentions come to life,” Major Thornhill says. “We have to make a plan and make sure that we follow through with that plan... If you’re someone who might feel like you’re in this all by yourself, this can be helpful to answer questions like ‘How am I going to make my corps grow?’ It is as simple as just one person. One person can affect change, and it can multiply.”

“We cannot be a church that sits in the pews and simply expects change to happen,” she continues. “This is us trying to fulfill the mission, not just of The Salvation Army, but the mission of Jesus Christ himself.”

The “Feet on the Street” resource will be available in full on the Ministry Toolkit platform beginning April 27. For additional information, contact the Mission, Evangelism & Cultural Ministries Department.
