# Being Rooted in Christ

As a child growing up in the United States of America, I remember well the excitement that surrounded the ushering in of a new year. December 31st possessed its own kind of magic, a mysterious energy that set it apart from other days on the calendar. It was a time to start over, to begin again, to atone for the mistakes of the previous 365 days.

For most of my childhood, our New Year’s Eve festivities followed a familiar pattern. In the early evening, my parents would pile us into the family car, and we would make the 20-minute drive to the local Salvation Army corps. Throughout the night we would celebrate the approaching new year with food, fellowship, and worship. The midnight hour would find the congregation gathered around the altar in a solemn act of rededication to God, committing ourselves once again to live holy, obedient lives in the coming year. Those good times are indelibly etched in my memory. Through this and other experiences in my youth I learned the importance of a continual assessment of one’s spiritual condition.

The Salvation Army’s ninth doctrine is a simple, straightforward statement that reminds us of the necessity of unbroken relationship with Jesus: *We believe that continuance in a state of salvation depends upon continued obedient faith in Christ*. It was essential for William and Catherine Booth, as they developed the Army’s central articles of faith, that this fundamental theological point be included.

The logic of the principle is solid and withstands scrutiny at all levels. Simply put, salvation is intended not only to save us, but to continually change us through the intimate presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Such spiritual growth can only be achieved when we are in sync with the guidance of the Spirit. We believe then, that salvation is meant to transform us, to make us different than before while we were captive to our rebellious nature. For this transformation to occur, it is imperative that man cooperate with God in holy, obedient relationship. Conversely, it is impossible to grow in Christ when the relationship is strained by human disobedience. Our will must be aligned with God’s will if we ever intend to mature as followers of Christ.

The scriptures are clear as to the expectation of continued, obedient faith. In his discourse to the disciples as recorded in the 15th chapter of John, Jesus makes a definitive statement regarding the ongoing continuity of relationship with him: *“Remain in me and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me” (v 4)*. The interpretation of this profound statement is clear. Just as a branch cut from a tree will lose its life source and surely die, we too will forfeit our spiritual vitality, our very capacity to live holy lives for God, if we do not remain in faithful relationship with Christ.

Likewise, Paul, in his letter to the Church at Colossae, re-states the thoughts of Jesus when he says, “So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in Him, rooted and built up in Him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness” (Colossians 2:6-7). We return then to our original doctrinal premise and logically conclude that without continued communion with Christ, our ability to remain obedient is surely diminished and our salvation jeopardized.

In this new year, it behooves us all to re-examine our current relationship with Christ. Is it all that it should be? Are we truly rooted in him? Are our wills and desires synchronized with the Spirit’s intentions for our lives? These are all pertinent questions as we contemplate the fruitfulness of tomorrow. In 2025, will we be the true reflection of Christ? Time will tell. I encourage you to redeem that time wisely, intent on guarding the sanctity of your salvation.

*“In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven” (Matthew 5:16).*
