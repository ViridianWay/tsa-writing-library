# Jubal's Lyre: Music is Not Magic

We can sometimes be tempted as Salvationist musicians to distort music’s role and power. While music does have great power, it is not magical, nor can we conjure God’s Spirit through it. Yet, sometimes we persist in our misunderstanding, claiming at times that what we do as musicians brings on God’s glory. One event in the life of the future King Saul, repeated in various ways in the Bible, points this out.

In 1 Samuel 10:5-6 we learn the future King Saul becomes inspired by God’s Spirit when music is present: *“Then when you reach the Hill of God (Bethel), where the Philistine governor resides, you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the hill-shrine, led by lute, harp, fife and drum, and filled with prophetic rapture. Then the spirit of the Lord will suddenly take possession of you...”* Yes, Saul becomes an inspired leader, at least at first, and scripture tells us that God gave him a new heart. Music does not do this; it is but an adjunct, a servant of the Lord’s will. We must guard against thinking music provides the principal vehicle for inspiration. The inspiration comes from God; music is but an aid to the process.

During Saul’s reign as king, we learn in 1 Samuel 16:14-23 that the future King David, due to his excellent musical skills, acts as a kind of musical therapist for the afflicted ruler: *“Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him... ‘Find someone who plays well and bring him to me,’ [said Saul] ...whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take his harp and play. Then relief would come to Saul, and he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.”* My, what scenes these must have been, the talented David helping via music to soothe the man who will soon try to destroy his perceived rival. Just a short time later, David’s music no longer does the trick. In 1 Samuel 18:10-11 Saul tries to pin David to the wall with a spear, but David escapes. We also read how Saul’s jealousy grew, with music playing a further role. In 1 Samuel 19:9-11 and other passages there is celebration of David’s victory over Goliath. Women are singing, dancing, and playing the tamborine, making merry as they sing, *“Saul has his 1000, David his 10,000.”*

It took me time to learn as a young Salvationist musician and bandmaster that “it is not the music, stupid.” Music can aid in bringing to everyone, whether performer or listener, a host of emotions from joy to sorrow, from exultation to melancholy. What we must always remember is that God would have us use our musical gifts and musical experiences wisely, both for His Kingdom and for joy in His creation. We must not use the gift of music in any manipulative way.

In next month’s offering, we will encounter in more detail the consummate, musician archetype of the Bible: David, the great singer and poet.
