# Southern Territory Achieves Better Business Bureau Accreditation

In 2024, the Southern Territory made great strides towards transparency and accountability for all existing and potential donors. On November 7, The Salvation Army USA Southern Territory became an accredited charity through the Better Business Bureau (BBB), a process that required rigorous evaluation but will in turn show our credibility and trustworthiness as a charity.

Southern Territorial Commander Commissioner Kelly Igleheart explains that the idea of pursuing this accreditation, which will communicate to the public The Salvation Army’s commitment to transparent stewardship, stemmed from a conversation he had with a National Advisory Board member. “Mr. Art Taylor, who serves as the chief executive officer, shared with me that the BBB Wise Giving Alliance specifically evaluates charities and churches. He advised that this is the best category for The Salvation Army to apply.”

“The BBB has 20 standards that must be met” to receive this accreditation, Major Todd Hawks, territorial community relations and development secretary, and the one selected to steer this enormous project, explains. “Each standard requires providing backup to show we met those standards.”

For these standards, the BBB assesses the charity’s governance and oversight, measures the charity’s effectiveness, delves into their finances and financial systems in place, and reviews all solicitations and informational materials distributed through direct mail and online.

“The process of application involved the collaboration of departments at Territorial Headquarters such as Community Relations and Development, Communications, Audit, and Finance, who worked together to meet every requirement,” Commissioner Igleheart says. “This resulted in the Southern Territory becoming the first territory to successfully be approved by this prestigious organization.”

Following this strict evaluation, Major Hawks says, “as a BBB accredited charity, we are provided a seal indicating we have met the 20 standards. This seal is placed on all local websites and can be used in several ways to inform local donors.” This accreditation and seal encompass the entire territory. Every Southern Territorial Salvation Army unit is also now BBB accredited through this process.

Major Hawks explains that the territory will have this accreditation for two years, at which time we will be able to renew, keeping us accountable in the eyes of outside businesses, fellow charities, and donors.

During the review process it was discovered that The Salvation Army governance model is similar to other charities in many ways but has several significant differences. To address this, the BBB determined that the Southern Territory would be allowed to utilize a church model alongside our traditional model of governance already in place. This led to the creation of a Territorial Advisory Council (TAC).

The members chosen for the inaugural TAC were carefully and prayerfully selected by leadership. “We chose volunteers with an affinity for The Salvation Army and expertise in finance, community service, or are leaders,” Major Hawks explains.

The eminent members of the first Southern Territorial Advisory Council are Nick Harrell, Frederick Johnson, Kathy Serrano, Wanda Ziembinski, and Joey Zumaya.

These esteemed members met for their first meeting in December 2024 and will continue to meet annually with the territorial commander, the chief secretary, the business administrator, and the community relations and development secretary. Their responsibilities will include the three key duties required by BBB standards — reviewing the annual territorial audit, reviewing the incoming budget, and giving advice related to any conflicts of interest — as well as providing expert advice according to their knowledge and expertise.

Major Hawks tells us, “The first meeting went very well. The territorial commander inducted the new members and provided an overview of expectations. Then, the business of reviewing the financial year for 2025 budget and past audit was completed.”

“Being an accredited charity [through the BBB] adds depth to our credibility among prospective donors who are unsure about which charity they want to support,” Major Hawks says. “Officers and development team members from our territory have emailed or called and thanked us for taking this important step. We hope that the other three territories will do the same.”

Commissioner Igleheart says, “In an era when donors are becoming more educated and expect accountability, The Salvation Army in the South is also accredited by ECFA (Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability). Both the BBB and ECFA are gold standards that demonstrate an organization’s transparency and accountability.”

The new BBB seal of approval can be seen at the bottom of territorial and corps websites, along with our ECFA seal. The new accreditation can also be viewed on the BBB website along with more details on the rigorous standards the territory has successfully met and will continue to maintain.
