# There’s No Place Like Home

March 26, 2025, was a day of pure blessing for Mallory and her two children. Nearly two years had passed since a devastating tornado tore through Wynne, Arkansas, leaving their house beyond repair. But that bright spring day marked a turning point — a fresh start — celebrated through the dedication of their brand-new home.

At the center of Mallory’s journey stood The Salvation Army. From the initial response and through the long road of recovery, The Salvation Army was a steady, faithful presence. The organization helped fund critical case management and stepped in to meet needs that insurance couldn’t cover. For Mallory, that support made all the difference in turning hope into reality.

But The Salvation Army didn’t work alone. Through the Long-Term Recovery Group, it collaborated with other compassionate partners, sharing resources, volunteers, and expertise. Mennonite Disaster Services and others brought construction support and materials, but it was The Salvation Army’s determination to see families like Mallory’s through every phase of recovery that helped bring everything together.

Leanne Lovell, Long-Term Recovery Group manager, walked this difficult road alongside many families. “I have witnessed such heartache, truly felt the pain of others as they recounted surviving that terrible night,” she shares, her voice tender. “And in these past two years, I’ve made so many dear friends. I’ve seen incredible things happen, obstacles overcome, and unexpected opportunities arise. I have witnessed the immense generosity of people who give so much without expecting anything in return.”

The Salvation Army’s leadership helped open the door for organizations like Mennonite Disaster Services to join the effort. Their skilled volunteers and donated materials brought the project to life. Working together with community partners, they transformed a once-empty lot into a place of peace and safety for Mallory and her children — part of a small but mighty community of four new homes built through this collaboration.

Matt Troyer-Miller, regional operations coordinator for Mennonite Disaster Services, played a key role in identifying the land and overseeing the builds. He spoke of volunteers coming from across the country, united by a shared sense of purpose. In under 90 days, Mallory’s home was completed — a testament to what can be accomplished through faith and teamwork. When asked about the meaning behind their efforts, Troyer-Miller’s response was simple and rooted in belief: “Rejoice in the Lord.”

The dedication ceremony overflowed with love; housewarming gifts, a cherished Bible, and a meaningful wall hanging all served as symbols of care and connection. A special blessing was offered, filling the home with prayers of hope and gratitude. Surrounded by so much kindness, Mallory was overcome. Her simple, heartfelt “Thank you” said it all.

In those two words lay the story of what can happen when people come together with purpose. The Salvation Army, through its leadership and collaborative efforts, didn’t just help rebuild a house — they helped restore a family’s sense of home, hope, and belonging.
