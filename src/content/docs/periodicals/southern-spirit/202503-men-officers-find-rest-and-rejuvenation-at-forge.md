# Men Officers Find Rest and Rejuvenation at FORGE

“I spent the last week pursuing some of my passions — adventure, worship, healthy living, and deep connection with other men of faith. I’ve been challenged to be the husband, father, and leader that God created me to be.”

These are the words of Captain Ryan Meo, Adult Rehabilitation Center administrator in Memphis, Tennessee, and they are shared in the afterglow of a memorable time of fellowship, worship, rest, and community for active male officers, auxiliary captains, and sergeants across the USA Southern Territory. From January 14-17, more than 200 men gathered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for the FORGE Territorial Men Officers Retreat. The aim for this assembly was to provide a time and space for men officers to be poured into, connect in community with their peers, and find physical and spiritual rest, with an eye toward the deep restoration that only God can provide.

Hebrews 4:12 served as the theme verse for both the retreat and its preparation: “The Word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double- edged sword. It cuts all the way through, to where soul and spirit meet, to where joints and marrow come together. It judges the desires and thoughts of the heart.”

Over the course of the four days, the spirit of community was evident, perhaps never more so than during an evening gathering on Wednesday, January 15. As part of a planned time of vespers to close the day, the men moved to the pool area at the hotel housing the conference, and what emerged was a stirring time of worship that also served as an outreach to other hotel guests.

“One of the highlights of the week was the guests of the hotel reaching out and asking what was happening that all of these men were worshipping and praying,” says Captain Derrick Smith, divisional youth secretary for the Texas Division. “I am thankful we had the opportunity to refresh and be empowered as ministers and men of the Gospel.”

The retreat featured several passionate and informative speakers, including Dr. Stephen Mansfield, Camilo Buchanan, and Territorial Commander Commissioner Kelly Igleheart. Dr. Mansfield, a New York Times best-selling author, encouraged attendees to tear down walls.

“May the Lord give you a passion to be the best that you can be in Jesus that defies every obstacle that might come into your life,” said Dr. Mansfield. “May we tear down, in the name of Jesus, all of the excuses and the fear and the hiding, to open our lives to righteous men who can sculpt us into what we are made to be in the image of Christ.”

“When men come together and bind themselves together, three things happen: There’s an anointing... there’s a refreshing... and there’s a blessing from the Lord.”

Buchanan, a leader, speaker, writer, and pastor who currently serves as the young adult ministry director at Passion City Church, challenged the men to fully surrender to God’s plan, embrace a life of purpose, and walk worthy of their calling. “The degree to which you surrender is the degree to which you will be successful in walking out the call of God,” Buchanan said.

“Don’t chase clout,” he continued. “Don’t chase coins. Don’t chase culture. Don’t chase comparison. Don’t chase control. Don’t even chase the law — chase Christ.”

Throughout the week, the men met with their assigned Life Groups, allowing for a more intimate setting which engendered support, encouragement, and spiritual development. The feedback was exceedingly positive, with memories made and the desired refuge provided for a time of openness.

“The conversation between officers usually focuses on the ministry or business of the Army,” says Captain Paul Ryerson, corps officer in Gwinnett County, Georgia. “The FORGE conference allowed us to approach the throne of God shoulder to shoulder, not just as officers, but as brothers in worship of the Father. For many of us, it allowed us to re-experience our calling all over again.”

While some conferences provide rigid structure, this event had the flexibility for attendees to engage in adventure opportunities or elect to rest and recharge. Some participated in a golf outing while others took part in deep sea fishing, jet skis, water taxis, and more. There were also invigorating focus groups during a Thursday evening session, many officers reporting strong takeaways from the “Balancing Fatherhood & Family in Your Ministry” session.

During the final meeting of the week on Friday, January 17, the men were blessed to listen to the spoken word ministry of Shawn Welcome, poet laureate for the city of Orlando.

Commissioner Igleheart then challenged the men to not just be hearers and processors of God’s Word, but rather to implement and practice what it says. Commissioner Igleheart reminded the officers that “the single biggest issue in the non-profit world is that you end up doing God’s work in a way that destroys God’s work in you,” delivering a poignant message of each individual having purpose in the eyes of God.

“All of us, at one time or another, are in the forge,” Commissioner Igleheart said. “You get heated up, and then somebody comes along and hits you with a hammer. And then they put you back in thinking that’s good for you. And they pull you back out and beat you some more.

“What if it’s not a person? What if it’s the Spirit of God working in you? The idea is you hammer it into a piece of barn wood, and it has some useful purpose. You can hang things on it. How much like officership is that? Not always out front and shining. No one’s paying attention to you, but you know what? You have a purpose in the Kingdom of God.”

The FORGE retreat may only have covered a four-day period, but its effects will be long-lasting in the officer ranks of the Southern Territory.

“My spirit was rejuvenated by the joy of the Lord and the fellowship of my fellow officers in the territory,” says Captain Jumaine Bernabe, corps officer in Williamsburg, Virginia. “This time was crucial for my well-being and provided an opportunity for me to reflect on my life as an officer, husband, father, brother, and friend.”
