The TSA Writing Library is a digital archive preserving and sharing the written heritage of The Salvation Army — from William Booth's earliest articles to present-day periodicals.

## What's in the Library

The archive currently includes over 290 writings spanning more than 130 years:

- **Library** — Articles, letters, and chapters from Salvation Army authors including William Booth, Catherine Booth, Bramwell Booth, and many others. Topics range from holiness and evangelism to social reform and practical ministry.
- **Collections** — Multi-chapter works organized for reading in sequence, such as *In Darkest England and the Way Out*, *The Founder's Messages to Soldiers*, *How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel*, and more.
- **Periodicals** — Ongoing articles from *The Southern Spirit*, the periodical publication of The Salvation Army's USA Southern Territory, covering faith, ministry, testimony, and the Army's mission across the South.

## How to Use the Library

**Browse and search** — The [Browse](/browse/) page lets you search all writings and filter by author, type, year, collection, or topic. The Southern Spirit has its own [browse page](/periodicals/southern-spirit/) with filters for author, year, and month.

**Read online** — Every writing is formatted for comfortable reading on any device. Multi-chapter works include navigation between chapters and a sidebar table of contents.

**Download** — Each article has a Download button that saves the writing as a Markdown (.md) text file, suitable for offline reading, archiving, or sharing.

## About the Project

This library is a volunteer effort to make Salvation Army writings more accessible. The historical texts have been carefully transcribed and preserved in their original form. Contemporary periodical articles are archived as they are published.

The site is open source and built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build). Contributions, corrections, and suggestions are welcome.
