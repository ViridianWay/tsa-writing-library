_Chapter 50 and Bibliography_

## CHAPTER 50
### Lonely Grave

This is the grave of Edward Dorris, a stagecoach driver who died of a sun stroke en route to Bent's Fort, which was located in what is now southeastern Colorado.

Edward worked for the Barlow and Sanderson Stagecoach Company for several years and had made many trips transporting passengers along the Santa Fe Trail. Bent's Fort was a stagecoach station for much of the 19th century. The fort marked the end of the line during some of that period, as the nearby Arkansas River was the nation's boundary with Mexico.

But during a journey that ended on July 21, 1865, Bent's Fort was literally the end of the line for Edward. An extremely hot and dry stretch of weather took its toll on the 31-year-old, and he finally collapsed a mere 100 yards or so from his desired goal and the relief he might have found had he reached the fort's main gate.

Of the thirteen graves located in this cemetery, twelve are covered with adobe bricks. Edward's grave is covered with limestone and is the only one that is marked with any identification. The cemetery has never been completely excavated.

Still, his is a lonely grave. Only the sentiment inscribed on his tombstone hints at the type of man he was: "Edward, thou hast gone to rest, In this far country of the West; Brothers and friends mourn and weep, Thou in this tomb dost sweetly sleep."

The 100 yards from his grave to his lost sanctuary serve to remind us that we can be "so near, yet so far" from "home."

The Bible asks the rhetorical question, "What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Matthew 16:26). Which then begs the question, What would Edward have given for just 100 more yards?

The born-again believer need not worry. Reaching the safety of Home is guaranteed by Christ's death and resurrection.

It is the best trip you'll ever make!

**Historical Context Note:** This final section, "Now You Know: Scripture," concludes the collection with a poignant reminder of life's brevity and the eternal significance of our spiritual journey. Chapter 50's story of Edward Dorris—dying just 100 yards from safety at Bent's Fort—serves as a powerful metaphor for the spiritual condition of humanity. The lonely grave in the Colorado wilderness reminds us that while earthly journeys may end in isolation and unfulfilled goals, the believer's journey leads to eternal fellowship with Christ. The bibliography that follows documents the extensive research and sources that Major Duracher drew upon to compile these 50 remarkable stories, demonstrating the rich historical foundation underlying each account. Together, these stories—from contemporary testimonies to historical chronicles to this final scriptural reflection—weave together the grand narrative of The Salvation Army's mission: that no one need remain spiritually lost or alone, for Christ has prepared the way home for all who believe.
