And I'm thanking God. Looks like I'm going to come down the stairs, doesn't it? I'm thanking God for this rich, rich privilege of having these days here at Juneau, Alaska, and with you. And I'm particularly excited, kind of humbled, but also particularly excited because this morning, I have an opportunity to fulfill a promise I made to the Lord himself. I said to the Lord that if I had the opportunity to be in worship and in the same place as my brother in Christ, Commissioner Israel Gaither, I would take the opportunity to embarrass him, know. I would take the opportunity to honor him. 

Uh, Brother Israel, would you just stand for a moment? Come on. I know, I know, you don't want to. I want to honor you today, brother. And I want to thank the Lord for you. Uh, because as I'm about to share with my family, you have played an integral role in my being here today. And that happened as a result of your determining that the Lord would be the leader of your life, that you would stay in tune with the spirit, that you would be surrendered to the leading of the Lord in your life and responsive to the Spirit's nudging. And because you were responsive and obedient, I want to celebrate you in his house this morning. Please be seated so you don't have to be embarrassed anymore. 

## A Testimony of Divine Intervention

But let me tell you. Let me tell you the story. This is a testimony and I have to be completely honest. It is off script and I know what the time limit is, so I'm going to have to just trust the Lord for this. But this will be a blessing to somebody in the House today, I have no doubt, and I'm sharing it to bring honor and glory. Not to Commissioner Israel or to Linden, but glory to God, my wife and I serving as officers in a very difficult time in our ministry. We had been hugely hurt, frustrated, disappointed, uh, and struggling. Struggling with our call, struggling with our future. 

And we had been approached by the leadership of another church. An invitation had been made. Come join our team. Your kids will be settled. Your life will be good. Your ministry will be full. Come based on the hurt, based on the frustration, based on the disappointment. This appeared a very attractive alternative. Still in ministry. Still serving the Lord. But over here and not over here are we were entertained by this. It would be true to say. We even agreed to meet with the church eldership team to have a meal together to explore the possibilities. That meeting was going to be on a Friday. 

On the Wednesday we had to attend. Had to attend. We were invited to it. No, we had to attend. We had to attend. We had to attend offices, councils. We had to attend officers councils. We had to go and listen to the then chief of the staff at officers councils. One commissioner, Israel Gaither. We got up that morning, we got ready. We made our way to the hall. We sat in the congregation. That's what's going on for us. Distracted, hurt. Frustrated, disappointed. Thinking about in the meantime, God, the Holy Spirit moving in the life of one Israel Gaither prompted him in the morning as he was preparing for the officer's councils and changed his focus and his intended Address, and when he climbed into the pulpit on that Wednesday morning, he said, this has only happened to me very rarely, but I felt led this morning to shift the focus of my address. And what I want to talk to you about is your officer's covenant. What did it mean when the Lord called you? What are you doing with your covenant today? And how will you be living out your covenant tomorrow for the next thirty minutes or so? 

The Lord used this brother in Christ to speak to Bronwyn and I in a way that, quite honestly, was completely undeniable. He was talking to us. Oh man. It's like, talk about that two edged sword that's cutting right in. Oh, yeah. Who do you think you are? I called you to this. I commissioned you to this. I ordained you to this. I'm not leading you anywhere else. Get over yourselves. Men are men. This is what I called you to. Roman and I found ourselves kneeling in the place that had been the cause of such hurt and frustration to us in the very mercy seat. There we were in those moments, saying to the Lord, we hear you. You chose a pretty powerful servant with that beautiful radio voice and that impassioned preaching. Lord, you used your servant. He was obedient to you, and we're the recipients of that word from you. And here we are. 

And in those moments, Bronwyn and I surrendered ourselves once again to the leadership of the Lord in our lives and his calling on us to serve within this part of the body of Christ. Not reluctantly, not with bitterness, not with frustration and disappointment, but with joy, with passion, with enthusiasm. And we knelt in that place on that day and said, we will never visit this again. We are here. We are in. Count us in. We're all in. The Lord has spoken. That's the end of it. And here we are today. Wow. 

Now. I'm saying this to you because I just want you to kind of picture this, that, that this. This is the divine weaver. This is God moving in his people, amongst his people, speaking to his servants, guiding, prompting, leading his servants who have surrendered control of their own selves to the leadership and the Lordship of Christ in their lives. Is he? I'm not embarrassing you. I'm just telling the truth. Your responsiveness to the spirit, your willingness to hear his voice, your willingness to be obedient to him, your willingness to recognize that you're not in charge but he's in charge. Your willingness to make yourself a servant to him was used on that day to speak God's Word into our hearts and lives. And we are here because you were faithful. I thank you, brother. I thank you, and I rejoice in the fact that all over the world right now, even today, this is happening. 

Men and women who realize and acknowledge the Lordship of Jesus Christ. The leadership of the King of Kings in their lives and are responsive to his leading to his prompting to his directing, are being used by him to bring transformation into the lives of others, growth into the lives of others, hope into the lives of others. This is a beautiful thing, and the father invites all of us to participate in this work of redemption that he is doing in the world, reconciling all things to himself through the cross. We celebrate the reality of God's desire to work in us and through us, for his glory and for the extension of his kingdom. Are you on board with that? Come on, let me just tell you that what I've discovered in my thirty five years of officership is it's easy to say, and it's hard to do. It's easy to say, and it's hard to do. 

## Paul's Passionate Letter

Paul, when he wrote his letter to the Colossians, he kind of blew them away with the contents of his letter. It's a pretty powerful letter, really. I think I'd love to meet Paul one day I will. But, um, you know, I think, uh, he's an interesting character. Bronwyn referred to it a little bit last night. Highly intelligent, I think. Absolutely wired. Right? I mean, I think he was. He was one wired guy. He was clearly on mission. He was clearly fully in, clearly very passionate. He's writing his letter probably from prison. Yet he's finding reasons to give joy, to give praise. He's he's he's finding he's finding that he can even speak hope as he's writing out to believers from his own hopeless situation, seemingly even in that space, he's still speaking hope. He's still speaking love. He's still promoting the master. He. Whatever the circumstances, I'm going to praise. Whatever the circumstances. I'm going to sing. Whatever the circumstances. I'm going to acknowledge the King. I'm going to write about them. I'm going to talk about them. I'm going to sing about them. I'm going to lift him up. I don't care if you put me in chains. I don't care if you cause me to suffer. I'm living to give breath and voice to the reality of God, the creator of the universe, who's made himself known to us most intimately in the person of Jesus Christ. I'm going to do all I can to point people to the master. This is Paul writing. 

I love that first chapter, man. He's just right in there. Right in there with this truth about the supremacy of Christ. We did that a couple of sessions ago. The creator of the universe, the one who's holding all things together, the one who is the head of the body, the church, the one who has conquered death, the one who has overcome the power of sin, the one who has broken down the gates of hell. This is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. He is saying he is enough. He is enough. He is enough. It's beautiful. 

People are absorbing this truth. I hope that we, while we've been here, have been absorbing this truth, reconnecting with this reality that Jesus, God's revelation of himself to us, the exact representation of the father, says Hebrews. In former days he spoke to us in various ways through prophets and other means. But in these days he has spoken to us through His Son, who is the exact radiance of his glory. You've seen the sun. You've seen the father. They are one. He is the King of kings. It's Paul writing to the Colossians. He's the one. 

## The Great Mystery Revealed

Then he absolutely blows their mind with this new thing for them to contemplate. This is our focus this morning, just for a few minutes, right in verse twenty seven and verse twenty seven, he says, now I want to reveal to you the mystery of the ages, the mystery of the ages. I want to reveal this to you so that you know and that you understand the glorious riches of this mystery which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Wow. 

Wait a minute. Let's just unpack this. As you're reading this letter, you are being reminded that, uh, he is the creator of the universe. All powerful, all wise. You are being reminded that it is he who holds the cosmos together, right? He is the one that is holding it all together. That's what Paul is writing. Understand who we're talking about. The King of Kings, the Lord of Lords. The one who created the universe, the one for whom the universe belongs. The one who is holding the cosmos together. The one who knows the beginning from the end. The one who is all wise. The one who is all powerful. This is our Lord Jesus Christ. 

And here's the great mystery. The mystery is Christ in you. Not as an idea, not as a concept, not as a pretty thought, but as a reality. He comes to dwell in you. He told us he was going to do it. He said it in John's Gospel. It's recorded for us in the fourteenth chapter. He makes it clear. You follow me, you listen to me. You make you may obey my voice, and we will come and make our home with you. We will come and we will dwell with you. He comes to occupy us. Oh my goodness. You've got to just let this sink in a little bit because there are ramifications galore. When you contemplate the reality of the risen Christ who makes his home in you. Oh, wow. 

You know, I got to tell you, uh, if this doesn't sort of do something to the way we walk, I don't know what will. I've said I've been recorded. I've said this before, and so I can't deny it anymore. I have said this in public that I think you have to forgive me. I'm a New Zealander. We kind of just try and keep things very basic and very real. But I think, I think the reality of this experience should do something to our walk. I mean, we're humble, of course, but also the king of kings dwelling in me. All right. You understand what I'm saying to you, right? You get this, don't you? You understand what I'm saying? It's like. Hello? 

I don't know what happens to you when you get up in the morning and look at the mirror when I get over the shock. I mean, I'm sixty three and I feel thirty six, but when I look in the mirror. Oh my word. That is a shock. When you get over the shock of that, I don't know what you're saying to yourself as you start your day, regardless of your circumstances, but wouldn't it be a beautiful thing if each of us got up in the morning and reminded ourselves both of the beauty and the challenge of this? Not only am I a child of the king, but the King himself occupies me by his spirit. Oh my word. Come on. Hey, we're going to be saying to the world, bring it on. We're going to say, don't worry about the frustrations and the hassles and the difficulties. I got the king Dwelling in me. You think about that. 

## Christ's Fullness Within Us

Who is it that's dwelling the King of kings, the risen King of kings by the power of His Holy Spirit, dwelling in the life of a believer. He doesn't just give you bits of himself. Right? He's not parceling it out and saying, well, there's only so much to go around, so you'll get this little bit and you'll get this little bit. Wait a minute. We've got ten more believers. I have to spread it out a little bit more. No, we've been already taught this week that we can't quite understand the mystery of this, but our king is everywhere present when he takes up the occupation of your heart. He comes in all his fullness. He's bringing everything. He's bringing everything. He's true to himself. He's not going to leave bits behind. 

So he comes with all his wisdom. With his knowledge, with his power. He comes with all of his love. Oh, man, oh, man. Think about that. You get up in the morning and go, oh, I'm loved. Even if I can't feel it, I know it's to be true. He's indwelling me with his love. He comes with his full self. Oh, this gives me such comfort. It gives me such comfort to know that. That I will never be alone. Oh, man. There's somebody that needs to hear that this morning. Whatever it is, brother or sister, hear me this morning. You are not walking alone. He dwells in you. He said in John fourteen. I'll make my home in you. Hello. I'm taking up residence in you, and I'm bringing everything that I am with me into your life and into your being. Or he's Purchased you by his blood, and he has come to dwell. He's come to occupy, and he's come in all his fullness. He's come with all of his radiance. He's come with all of his grace. He's come with all of his power. He's come with all of his purity. He's taken up residence within the life of a believer. Oh my goodness. 

## Making Room for the King

There has to be some adjustment. There's got to be some adjustment, surely. How do you make space for that? There has to be an adjustment. Hey, we've taken over somebody's house here in Juneau, Alaska. I don't know, man. Oh, dear dear dear dear dear. Woo hoo! We've we've taken up residence in a big way. We've got our whole family in this house. Are these dear people? They've moved out to make room. Pray for them, you know, because they're eventually going to come back and find everything that we've left behind. Uh, pray for them, but we've occupied that space. Now our family, we're in every room that it's possible to be in. We're up the stairs. We're in the bedrooms where we've taken over the house. It's a beautiful thing. 

I was thinking about this this morning. It's like, uh, if the if the residents came back right now, uh, there would not be any room for them. Somebody would have to leave. Something would have to go. Because my whole family, we've turned that place into Buckingham Palace. Right? That's Buckingham Palace right now. Put the sign on the front door. Uh, the king is in residence. This is Buckingham Palace right here. And we're loving it. We're loving it. Uh, but we have to make some adjustments. You know, we have to make some adjustments. We don't know where everything is. We don't know how everything works. Uh, we've got to figure things out together as a family. It's a big, fat adventure, and we're loving it. And I'm so grateful for the opportunity. 

But I was reflecting on that whole thing about it's like when people come to stay or to visit, you know, even if it's family, you've said it. I know you have. It was great to have them. It was great to have them, but. But now they're going home. Bye bye. Do come again. We can't wait for the next one. But then we all go back into the living room and we get back the chair that we've forfeited for our guests. We grab a hold of our remote from the TV screen and reset it to where it's supposed to be, and we occupy our space, right? You know it's true. This is what we do. Uh, we want people to come, but we also want people to go. Huh? We want to have the fellowship, but we also want the silence. We want to flick that channel back to our favorite program, right? We want to kick our shoes off, put our feet up and pick our nose without anybody judging, without anybody criticizing and without anybody looking. We know we want to do it. I'm just speaking the truth right now. We know, we know. 

And I want to tell you on a spiritual level, it's no different for us. When we have to, we have to we have to make adjustments. When the King of Kings comes to dwell, I mean, the truth is, it cannot be business as usual. 

## Putting the Old Nature to Death

Paul says to them, listen, you've got to put to death your earthly nature. Why? Because it's inconsistent with the guest who now occupies your life. The one who now has taken up residence. The King of kings, who has come not just to dwell in you, but has come to transform you. He's come living and active. And his goal is that day by day, in increasing measure, you will become more and more like him. Ah, he says in chapter three. Therefore rid yourself. Put it to death. Anything that belongs to the earthly nature. Be ruthless with it. Kill it. Knock it off. Consider it dead that you might experience and might know and might benefit from what it is to have fullness of Christ dwelling in your life. And there begins that internal battle. 

I don't know what it's like for you. I'm just going to tell truth now. Which you would expect right from me. Tell the truth. Come on, general, tell the truth. Um. My my my journey of discipleship has to be acknowledged as one where I have put the old nature to death. Right. I'm not having anything more to do with it is dead for me, only to find that somehow my old nature is a bit like a Lazarus. It just keeps coming back to life. I keep knocking that puppy off and it just keeps coming back. Anybody? Do you understand what I'm saying? Right? 

It happens with all the will in the world, with all the desire, with all the gratefulness that I have for God's love, his grace, his mercy in my life, for his fellowship, for the wisdom he brings, for the comfort he brings. Oh my goodness. The enemy just keeps wanting to bring that old nature back to life. He he finds some way to put those on it, right. Kind of breathe it back in. I've talked to the Lord about this. And I felt the Lord saying to me, the problem that you've got is that you're trying to put to death something that can only be put to death by me. Do you understand? You are kind of struggling in your own strength to deal with your old nature, and your old nature can only be dealt with by me. So you're trying to do in your own strength what can only be done with the strength that I've brought with me. 

## Setting Your Mind on Things Above

I felt the Lord saying to me, what I want you to do is shift your focus, shift your focus. Stop looking at the old nature. Stop focusing in on that stuff which is supposed to be dead to you. Don't focus there. Don't stay there. Paul, writing to the Colossians, he says, set your mind, set your heart. Set your focus on things above. Look to who you are in Christ. Look to the hope you have for eternity. Recognize that you are a citizen of the kingdom of heaven, that Satan has been slain, that evil has been conquered, that he is the victor, that a day is coming where you will be with him in glory. Set your minds on things above. 

Some people say that guy is so heavenly minded he's no earthly use. Have you heard that saying? I think that's the worst staying in the world. It is impossible for a child of God to be too heavenly minded. What we need in our day is men and women who are more heavenly minded, who have the future in their view, who understand what Jesus said. But for the agony of the cross, for the glory and the joy that would be, he suffered, right? Keep your eyes on the master. Hebrews twelve. Right. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author. And what the perfecter of our faith. Where are you putting your energy and attention? 

The devil is going to keep you in a space where he's going to continue to try and stir up within you your old nature. He will want you to conform rather than be transformed. Hear me, hear me. Paul, writing to the Romans, says, do not conform to the world, but be transformed by the renewing of what? The renewing of your mind. And he said to the believers, what I want you to do with your mind is I want you to set your mind right. Direct your mind towards the King of Kings, towards the Lord himself, towards the promises of God. Set your mind and your heart and your focus to the truths that you have come to understand about who God is his nature, his character, his holiness, his purity, his love for you, his name for you, his purpose for you, his hope for you, his will for you, his desire for you. Set your minds on the things that he has said to you and about you. Set your minds on those things that will draw you to him and allow him in the drawing to work in you that which is pleasing to him, and through you that which is glorifying to him for the extension of his kingdom. That's the space we need to occupy. 

Now I heed the instruction, because in the instruction you've read it, we read it this morning. You know, get rid of these things put to death, anger and malice. And there's a whole range of things that we know. The world, the evil one will use, if he can, to rob us of our promise, to rob us, of our understanding of who we have become in the person of Jesus Christ. He will do whatever he can to keep you in that space. And I'm suggesting to you this morning that in my own walk with the Lord, the victory, the victory that I celebrate, and that I give glory to God for The fullness of joy, the passion, the hope that is in mine, the joy that is mine. Despite circumstances. These come not because I've been busy trying to slash things out of my life. They've come because I've switched my focus to the King, whose promises are reliable and trustworthy. To the King who reminds me that he loves me. That he cares about me. That he has wisdom for me. That I won't walk alone, that he will make a way, that he will be. The way that I will be on the way. So long as I continue to surrender myself and be obedient to him and when I have shifted focus. Interestingly enough, those things that belong to the old nature. Not only do I not want to look at them, I just know they're dead. They're just dead to me. They're dead to me because I'm alive to him. 

## The Transformation Process

He comes to occupy. It's both beautiful and challenging. It's beautiful and it's challenging. But he occupies in order to transform, to make new, to heal, to restore, to develop, to orientate, to draw us to a likeness of Christ himself. Less of me. More of him, less of me. More of him. And in that sanctifying work, what emerges is the beautiful version of Linden that God intended made possible because Christ has taken up residence within. 

We need a Salvation Army that's full of men and women who know they're occupied by the King of Kings that he has taken up residence, and whose hearts and minds are set on him. I'll tell you why. Because when you spend time in that space, when you dwell in that space where he is King, where he is Lord, where he is the focus, where he is the one you're listening to and responding to and being obedient to. You know, the result of that is fruit, right? The result of that is aroma. You start to smell like Jesus. You start to have the aroma of the king. It's coming off you and you may not even be aware of it. You're just being obedient. You're just being surrendered. You're just trusting the master. You're just doing the things the master tells you to do. And you have no idea that your obedience and your surrender is the very thing that he's using to bless, to speak, to challenge, to witness to somebody else who comes alive as a result of the part that you have played, because you've had your eyes and your minds set not on the old nature, but set on the King of kings and set on the Kingdom. 

## A Vision for the Salvation Army

I want a Salvation Army that's absolutely full of men and women, whose minds and hearts are set on. The King of Kings will turn this world upside down through that. Oh my goodness, the Salvation Army. Can you imagine that? Oh my goodness. We think, you know, we're one hundred and sixty years old. We're looking pretty good actually. One hundred and sixty years old. It's frightening to me when I think about that. You know, we're one hundred and sixty years old, and I've been around for sixty three of them. That's all right. Some of you have been around a lot longer. Okay. I know some of you met Bramwell-booth. I'm just kidding. 

In these days, you know where people are kind of wondering about our future as part of the body of Christ. How the king is going to use this movement into the future. You feel a stirring, don't you? Something's happening. Now, God is speaking to us in these days. He's speaking to us about drift. He's speaking to us about distraction. He's reminding us we got a little bit of it, I think the other day with return to Your First Love. Mm. He's speaking to us in this day as a movement about just making sure as we move into this next chapter, we fully understand what the main thing is. Huh. 

The Salvation Army. We were challenged, met I think said a couple of times, Salvation Army. We're a proclaiming people. We are a proclaiming people. We're a storytelling people. We want people to know that God is for them, that God loves them, that God does not want to judge and to condemn. He's righteous. He can. He's justified. He can. But what he wants to do is rescue, redeem, restore, revive, renew. That's what he wants to do. We've got a story to tell that our God is on the business through Christ of redeeming, rescuing, restoring, renewing, making all things whole. This is our story. It's a beautiful story of the saving grace of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Salvation Army. Let's find our voice and tell the story. Tell the story. Always be ready to give the reason for the hope that is in you. 

We have, throughout our history testified that we are a holiness movement, that we believe that it is possible for God to indwell a person to the extent that the old nature is completely put to death, and we live in freedom and joy and power in and through our focus on the King of Kings, through surrender, through obedience, through trust, through honoring, through intentionally facing towards him and not away from him. 

Can you imagine an army of people around the world who understand that they are occupied by the creator of the universe, right? That they have a future and a hope that is secure in the glory of the King of Kings, an army that knows that. And so, as a result of knowing it, is empowered to tell a beautiful story by proclaiming it with their lips and backing it up with their action. So they live in purity. They live clean. They live free. They smell like heaven. And when you talk to them and when you touch them and when you're engaged with them, something of heaven comes down through them because of their connection and orientation towards the father. And whilst the world Might vocally make fun. The truth is, they're seeing us, and it brings hope. You bring hope. I want to be a part of that army. The king occupying the mouth. Being free. And the life and the action and the activity. Witnessing to the values of the Kingdom of God and pointing not to what might be, but pointing to that which will be. Because our God is faithful to all his promises. 

## Closing Prayer and Invitation

Let's pray together. Father, we're glad to be in your house. Uh, thank you for your Grace. Thank you for your love. Thank you for being here this morning with us. God. Uh, what a beautiful thing. That you want to occupy our hearts, that you want to take up residence in us. That's what we want. Father, we want that. We surrender to that. And if there's stuff that has to go, if there's some cleaning out that has to be done, if there's some stuff that has to be released, then. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. We will. Yes, sir. We will. And we'll do it by forgetting that stuff and focusing on you. God help us do in us that which with our best intent, we cannot do ourselves. We seek you this morning for a fresh anointing, for a reorganizing of our heart, mind and will for us surrendering to your leadership and lordship in our lives. And we invite you to occupy us in all your fullness. 

Listen, the teams going to minister Grace to us through music, and we've got a few moments, and I've promised the Lord that I would never, never, never not allow opportunity for somebody to respond if they want to. If you want to stand in the presence of the King while we're singing. And offer him again your heart, your mind and your will, and say, I'm oriented toward you, father. I'm in. Then you do that. If you want to kneel at this place of prayer and make that declaration to the King of Kings, that's worship. That's holy ground. That's sacred. That's beautiful. If you want to say to the Lord, Lord, I'm believing with you this morning for the future of this movement, right? I'm committing myself to pray and to be all that I can for you. Under the umbrella of the Salvation Army officers, you might want to stand or kneel in the presence of the King and say, I'm all in for this. Then we've got a few moments, only a few, so don't delay. If God's speaking and you want to pray and you want to seek him, come do it now, while our team helps us this morning. May the Lord himself occupy your heart.
