## Sanctification — What It Is

1. **What does The Army teach on the subject of Entire Sanctification?** That a man may be delivered from all sin, and enabled to do the will of God continually in his life.

2. **What is sin?** Sin is the transgression of the law. Doing that which we know we ought not to do, or refusing to do that which we ought to do.

3. **What are doubtful actions?** Doubtful actions are those about the rightness or wrongness of which we have a doubt.

4. **Are doubtful actions sinful?** Yes. the Bible represents them as such. "He that doubteth is damned," or condemned. Romans 14: 23. "Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth." Romans 14: 22

5. **Can sin be spoken of as an act and as a principle?** Yes, in the same way that you can speak of the fruit and the root of the tree. Sin, as an act, is the fruit; as a principle, it is the root.

6. **What is Sanctification?** Sanctification is the separation of the soul from sin, and the consecration of the soul to the will and service of God.

7. **Can sanctification be partial and can it be complete?** Yes; it is partial in nearly all persons when first converted and entire when they are fully saved.

8. **What is partial Sanctification?** It is being delivered from the power of sin, and yet having sin existing in the soul: sin is there, but it does not reign.

9. **What is the difference between this state and that of a man before conversion?** Before conversion, a man is actually under the power and domination of sin. He may see it to be evil, hate it, and struggle against it; but still he is under its power, and forced to obey it. For instance, see how men make resolutions, and break them directly. They cannot help but sin. A truly converted man has power over sin, but the root or the principle of sin is still in his soul.

10. **What is entire Sanctification?** Entire sanctification supposes complete deliverance. Sin is destroyed out of the soul, and all the powers, faculties, possessions, and influences of the soul are consecrated to the service and glory of God.

11. **Then a man in the three conditions named stands in three distinct relationships to sin?** Yes.  
    I. He can be under sin.  
    II. He can be over sin.  
    III. He can be without sin.

12. **Will you explain this further?**  
    I. In an unconverted state he is under sin.  
    II. In a justified state he is over sin.  
    III. In an entirely sanctified state he is without sin.

13. **What is Sinless Perfection?** Such a state as that of Adam before his fall, wherein he, being a perfect creature, was enabled to render a perfect obedience to the perfect law of God.

14. **It is possible to attain sinless perfection in this life?** No! An imperfect creature cannot perfectly obey a perfect law, and man, being imperfect both in body and in mind, is plainly unable to keep the perfect law of God.

15. **Then, The Army does not teach what is understood by the doctrine of sinless perfection?** Certainly not.

16. **But does God require obedience to a law the keeping of which he knows to be utterly impossible?** No. We cannot imagine a benevolent Being requiring from us that which is impossible, and then condemning us for not doing it.

17. **What then is the law that he expects us to keep?** The law of love, as laid down and described by Jesus Christ, when He said: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart," or, in other words, "Love and serve me with all the ability you possess, and I shall be satisfied."

18. **When we talk of Sanctification, or being sanctified, do we generally mean ENTIRE Sanctification?** Yes: and we also mean the same experience by such terms, as perfect love, or holiness, or the blessing, or full salvation, or a clean heart, and the like.

19. **If a man is what you call FULLY SAVED, or ENTIRELY SANCTIFIED, is he delivered from TEMPTATION?** No! Adam and Eve were tempted, and so was Jesus Christ, and they were holy; and the holier a man becomes, the more likely Satan is to tempt him. Holiness does not bring freedom from temptation, but victory over it.

20. **Does Sanctification mean that we are saved from mistakes in judgment?** No! That would be making us infallible. Still, sanctified souls are promised and so enjoy the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit: they acknowledge Him in all their ways, and He directs their paths.

21. **Does Holiness save men from bodily and mental infirmities?** No: but it frequently leads to a fuller sanctification of all the afflictions and infirmities from which saints suffer, and often to the exercise of faith for their deliverance. "And the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, and the Lord shall raise them up; and if he hath committed sins they shall be forgiven him." James 5: 15.

22. **Does Sanctification make it impossible to fall from grace?** No: Satan fell from Heaven, and Adam from Paradise, and they both were perfect, in a sense we can never be in this life; and we do not see any state of grace revealed in the Bible as attainable here from which it is not possible to fall. "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."

## Sanctification — Can It Be Attained? (Part 1)

1. **What is it that is denied about this experience by those Christians who differ with us on this subject?** It is positively said that we cannot be made holy in this life, but must go on sinning and repenting until death, all admitting that we must be made holy before we can enter Heaven.

2. **How can you prove that holiness may be enjoyed in this life?** My first argument is from PROBABILITY. It seems most likely that God should make provision for the immediate and entire deliverance of men from sin. If a child had got some poison into his body, we are all sure that the father of that child would use every means as soon as possible, not only to get a portion, but the whole of the poison drawn out. Just so we think most likely that God would use all possible means to get the whole of the deadly poison of sin out of the soul of man.

3. **But might it not be asked, in reply to this, why does not God save His people from their TROUBLES?** Yes; but that is altogether a different thing, because trouble is not sin; on the contrary, it is often, if not always a great blessing to those who love God; whereas, sin is evil, and always evil, hateful to God; and a curse to those who harbour it.

4. **How else would you prove that God wants to save men from all sin in this life?** From the plain teaching of the Bible, which describes this experience under different figures and in different ways.

5. **Will you name one of these figures?** I. As a clean heart — that is, a heart washed from all sin. "Create in me a clean heart, God; and renew a right spirit within me."—Psalm 51:10. "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." — Matthew 5:8. "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean." — Ezekiel 36:25.

6. **How else is this experience set forth in the Bible?** II. A heart delivered from all idolatry. "From all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you." — Ezekiel 36:25.

7. **Proceed with your Bible proof.** III. As being altogether separated from evil, and devoted to God. "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." — 1 Thessalonians 5:23.

8. **Give me another Bible statement of Holiness.** IV. As living such a blameless life that God Himself shall not see anything to condemn. "I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless." "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."—Romans 8:1.

9. **How else is this experience set forth?** V. As being as fully the Lord's on earth as we shall be in heaven. "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." — Romans 12:1.

10. **Does the Bible describe this state otherwise?** VI. As fulfilling the law. "Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." — Romans 13:10.

11. **Is it otherwise set forth?** VII. It is described as perfection — that is, perfection in love. "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect." — Matthew 5:48. That is, if we are as fully given up to lives of love and goodness, in our sphere, and according to our little ability, as our Heavenly Father is in His sphere, we shall be perfect before him. "Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe. — 1 Thessalonians 2:10.

12. **How else does the Bible hold this experience before us?** VIII. As following the Lord fully. Joshua and Caleb did this, and went into Canaan.

13. **Is there any other figure employed?** IX. As being dead to sin: as having the old man crucified, slain; as being freed from sin; as being alive to God. "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." Galatians 2:20.

14. **Have we anything further relating to this experience?** X. As being made altogether good. "Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit." — Matthew 12:33. "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world; and more abundantly to you-ward." — 2 Corinthians 1:12. "And herein do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men." — Acts 24:16. "But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world." —Galatians 6:14.

## Sanctification — Can It Be Attained? (Part 2)

1. **In what other way does the Bible teach the attainment of holiness in this life?** The Bible PROMISES it. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." — 1 John 1:9. "Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ: to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen." — Hebrews 13:20, 21. "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting Holiness, in the fear of God." — 2 Corinthians 7:1.

2. **Does the Bible set forth in any other way that this experience is attainable?** Yes: The Bible COMMANDS it. "But, as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; Because it is written, 'Be ye holy, for I am holy."' — 1 Peter 1: 15, 16. "My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:" — 1 John 2:1. "That ye put off concerning the former conversations, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts. And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness, and true Holiness." — Ephesians 4:22, 24. "For in that He died, He died unto sin once: but in that He liveth, He liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord." — Romans 6:10, 11.

3. **Does the Bible show in any other way that men can be entirely sanctified?** Bible PRAYERS prove it. "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." — John 17: 17. "That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life." — Luke 1:74, 75. "Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory forever and ever." — Hebrews 13:20, 21.

4. **In what other way does the Bible insist on Entire Sanctification?** The Bible declares that PROVISION has been made for this deliverance from sin. "Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins." — Matthew 1:21. "Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself, a peculiar people, zealous of good works." — Titus 2:14. "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" — Hebrews 9: 14. "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the Devil." — 1 John 3:8. "Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish." — Ephesians 5:25, 26, 27

5. **Have you any further argument to show that God's people can be made pure in heart in this life?** Yes, the EXPERIENCE of God's people shows this.

6. **Can you give the names of any Bible characters who seem to have enjoyed this experience?** Yes; Enoch, and Moses, and Job, and many others, but we simply name the Apostle Paul, and give his experience in his own words. "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." — Philippians 1:21. "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ." — 1Corinthians 11:1. "And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith." — Philippians 3:9. "Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe." — 1 Thessalonians 2:10. "For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing." — 2 Timothy 4:6, 7, 8.

7. **Is there any other argument to prove that it is possible to enjoy this experience?** Yes; we think that all Christians will admit that in those moments when they realise the greatest nearness to God they feel the strongest urgings of the Spirit to present their bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God.

## Sanctification — the Conditions

1. **What are the conditions of Entire Sanctification?** Conviction, renunciation, consecration and faith.

2. **Explain the first.** By CONVICTION for the blessing, we mean that a person must feel HIS NEED OF BEING HOLY; he must see the hatefulness of the sin that is left within him, from which God wants to deliver him; he must be convinced, also, that, if he seek deliverance with all his heart, he will find it. Unless a man sees his need of the blessing, and that it is to be obtained and enjoyed by him, he will not seek it with all his heart.

3. **What is the second condition of Sanctification.** The renunciation, or giving up, of all known evil and of everything that seems doubtful. There must be the willingness to put away and part forever with all and everything which the soul knows to be wrong, or has any good reason to fear is not right.

4. **Should you tell a man seeking the blessing who smoked and drank that he must give up his pipe and his glass?** Yes, I should: because, in this age, especially in The Army, few, if any, can smoke or drink without feeling both to be wasteful, injurious, and unclean habits; and, if they feel them such, or have even a question about their lawfulness, the indulgence must be given up at once, for he that doubteth is condemned.

5. **Are there any passages of Scripture which show these habits to be wrong and altogether unworthy of a follower of Christ?** Yes, any number. We give three, but the whole tenor of the Bible, and the whole spirit of Christianity, is against them. "Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." — 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18. "Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord." — Isaiah 52:11.

6. **Do you think that a person seeking the blessing should be willing to give up flashy and fashionable DRESS?** Yes. All who desire to walk closely with the Lord must have serious misgivings about superfluous and unnecessary adornment; and, if there be a serious misgiving about the lawfulness of any habit, it cannot be practiced without condemnation, and, whether it be in dress on business or family arrangements, or anything else, if there be reason to think it wrong and displeasing to God, it must be given up.

7. **Can you give any Scripture to show that God is against gay and fashionable apparel?** "Moreover the Lord saith, because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with retched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts." — Isaiah 3:16, 17. "In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works." — 1 Timothy 2:9, 10.

## Consecration

1. **What is the third condition?** The actual present surrender to God of the whole man and all we possess.

2. **Will you explain this more particularly?** Yes, gladly, as there are more serious mistakes made on this point than on any other in practical religion.

3. **In order to show you what true consecration is, please describe to me that conduct of Adam which has unfortunately made it necessary?** Adam forsook a life of entire and constant service of God, and set up independent of Him. He ceased to be a servant of Jehovah, and went, so to say, into business on his own account, as his own master. He gave up living to please God, and started to live to please himself.

4. **What conduct, then, is necessary in order that Adam's successor, who is on the same lines as he was, may get back again to the same place in the confidence and favour of God that Adam occupied?** He must give up being his own master and living to please and profit himself, and go back to God with all he possesses, much or little, and lay himself at Jehovah's feet, and offer to live wholly to please and profit Him.

5. **What is the great mistake made with regard to consecration?** It is not a reality with many. They pretend to give God their all — their children, money, and possessions; their time and reputation; but it is only in imagination, in sentiment. It is not real. God and His cause are no better off after it than they were before; and the next day these people, who said at the altar the previous night that they gave all they had to God, go about acting on the principle that all they have is their own, to be spent for their own pleasure, and their own profit, just as they did before.

6. **Can you illustrate the kind of consecration God wants, before He will sanctify me throughout, body, soul and spirit?** A long time back, in this country, there was a war between the king and the parliament, and the greater part of the nation took the side of the parliament, and king was sorely pressed. It was then no uncommon thing for a nobleman or rich person to come in to the king, and say, "I am sorry and ashamed that your majesty should be driven from your throne, and be suffering all this indignity and disgrace, and I want to help your majesty to get your rights again; and I have come with my sons and my servants, to place our swords and our lives at your disposal. I have also mortgaged my estate and sold my plate, and brought the proceeds to help your majesty to carry on the war." Now, that was a real consecration to that king: it was the laying of life and substance at his feet.

Now, that is just the kind of consecration God wants — only, one that goes deeper down still. He has been driven from His throne in the hearts of men everywhere: His name is cast out as evil, and men universally refuse to have him to reign over them. Now, Jesus Christ wants to secure the kingdom for His Father, and appeals for true—hearted soldiers who will help Him to succeed in this great undertaking, and He wants you to come into the camp in the same spirit that these men of old did to their earthly king when he was in those desperate straits — to come, saying, "I bring my goods, my influence, my reputation, my family, aye, my life. I will have no separate interests: use all I have, and am to promote the war, so that my King shall have His own, and His throne shall be established." That is consecration in reality, and that only. This is what Jesus Christ taught when He said, "Seek first the kingdom of God." This is what Jesus Christ exemplified in His life and death. This is what Paul and the first apostles did; and, if you are to be a thorough Christian, you must be consecrated in the same way.

7. **Then a true consecration has in it the nature of a sacrifice?** Decidedly so. It is a real sacrifice. It is the presentation or giving away of all we have to God; a ceasing any longer to own anything which we have hitherto called our own, but all going over into God's hands for Him to order and arrange, and our taking simply the place of servants, to receive back again just what He chooses. This, it will be perceived, if a reality, is no easy task, and can only be done in the might of the Holy Ghost; but, when it is done, when all is laid on the altar — body, soul, spirit, goods, reputation, all, all, all — then the fire descends, and burns up all the dross and defilement, and fills the soul with burning zeal, and love, and power. "Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easy beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us." — Hebrews 12:1.

8. **Has not true consecration something in common with CRUCIFIXION?** Yes, undoubtedly, it is a real crucifixion. Crucifixion was an ignominious, painful death; and consecration means dying to all those pleasures and gratifications which flow from the undue love of self, the admiration of the world, the ownership of goods, the inordinate love of kindred, and friends, which go together to make up the life and joy of the natural man. To do this is always a painful task, and yet we must be crucified with Christ if we are to live with Him. "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me." — Galatians 2:20.

9. **You say Crucifixion is IGNOMINIOUS and PAINFUL** Yes! But the pain is transient, and generally swallowed up by divine joy. Afterwards comes the joy of being able to suffer and endure for Him in whom the soul delights. And this love — the bond of perfectness — so overtops the love of other things, and the pain of suffering and deprivation, that one is able to glory in the cross on which the crucifixion took place. "But we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; "and patience, experience; and experience, hope." — Romans 5:3, 4.

10. **Is it possible to rise above ignominy as well as pain?** Certainly. If a man is dead to the praise of the world, if he, like God, counts the wisdom of the world to be foolishness — if the change has really been wrought­ represented by the word death —so long as he remains thus changed — thus dead — he despises the shame. "Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame." — Hebrews 12:2.

11. **Is not a complete consecration of the utmost importance in seeking holiness?** Undoubtedly. Without a real consecration there can be no true holiness. And it is generally on account of defective consecration that some souls experience so much difficulty in the exercise of faith for purity. There cannot be full salvation without full surrender. God can neither save nor keep what is not given to Him. "Yea, doubtless, I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ." — Philippians 3:8.

## Faith

1. **What is the fourth condition?** FAITH, or TRUST. Sanctification is received by faith in the same way as pardon.

2. **What is the faith that sanctifies?** It is that act of simple trust which, on the authority of Christ's Word, says, "The blood of Jesus Christ does now cleanse me from an inward sin, and makes me pure in heart before Him." "The soul gasping for the blessing of Purity, cries out, 'I believe He is able to cleanse me!' — that is faith in God's power. 'I believe He is willing!' — this is faith in the Divine willingness to fulfill the promises. 'I believe He is able and willing to cleanse me now, just as I am!' — better still, this; for it is appropriating faith. 'I believe He will do it! — Hallelujah! Every other reliance is denounced, now it is certain you will be cleansed. 'I believe He does save me. I sink into His arms; the promise is sure; I believe that I now receive the things I ask, the Spirit Himself beareth witness; I am saved, fully-perfectly saved!' This is faith in the actual."

3. **When a soul thus trusts God, will he be, in every case, made clean?** Yes, always. That is, if a soul, having the assurance that he does fully renounce all known and doubtful wrong-doing, and gives himself up to the doing of the will of God in all things, thus trusts God for this full cleansing, he has the authority of God's Word for believing that the work is done, no matter how he feels; and must hold on to this faith until the feeling comes. If we confess our sins, He is faithful (to His own promise) and just (to the suffering and agony of His Son, which purchased the blessing) to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

4. **What is meant by holding on till the feeling comes?** Sometimes God tries faith for a little time, and, although the soul has the witness that he has put his sacrifice on the altar — that he is fully consecrated, and has the witness in himself — that he believes that God accepts it; still, he may have, like Abraham of old, to wait for the fire, which not only makes him inwardly feel and know that God cleanses his soul, but if he watches his sacrifice, and waits a season, the fire will assuredly come.

5. **Do many seek this blessing without finding it?** Yes, multitudes do; and then, because they do not find it, they go about saying it is not attainable.

6. **Can you name some reasons why so many seek and do not find?** In general it is because they do not seek this kingdom of God with all their hearts.

7. **Do not many fail to obtain the blessing because they refuse to make the full surrender?** Yes. They go on well until they come to the point where they have to make the sacrifice of some darling idol, or when they see it will interfere with their reputation, or where they see it means selling all they have to help forward the kingdom, then they hesitate, refuse, and go away sorrowful in many instances, it is to be feared, to declension and backsliding.

8. **But do not many stumble at the simplicity of faith?** Yes! Doubtless, many whom we have every reason to believe really do give up all, and are willing to follow the Lamb, whithersoever He goeth, cannot, or will not, or dare not believe that God does, there and then, cleanse them. They are always coming up to the edge of the cleansing wave, stripped and ready for the sanctifying plunge, but, alas! They do not step in.

9. **Do not many of these say they do believe, and yet do not get any further?** Yes: they say they believe, and they do believe something about God's willingness or ability, but they do not believe that God does, really and truly, now cleanse; and you must press them to this, drive them up to it; and when they do really trust God for a full salvation, you will see the difference in them.

10. **Are not seekers after holiness, like seekers after pardon, much hindered by looking at their feelings?** Yes, they are: and you must always be on your watch against this hinderance also. Get them off from looking at themselves and their feelings, to looking to God. You cannot too plainly and repeatedly press upon their attention that it is God that saves; that their work is to trust God, and that it is God's work to save them — that they must believe first, and feel afterwards.

Advising seekers of holiness, one has said, "You are called upon to exercise a high and commanding faith — a faith that claims ample provision in the Gospel for entire deliverance from sin — power in the blood of Christ to cleanse you from all sin, and to accomplish this work, not at some future, indefinite time, but now — just as you are. You are to yield nothing to the suggestions of the enemy, or the timidity of shrinking self, but claim the immediate application of the cleansing blood, washing away every stain, and bringing into your soul all the fullness of God and all the fruits of the Spirit."

"Do you now exercise this faith? Do you, this moment, claim for yourself the complete efficacy of the atonement, extending to every defect and every want of your soul? Do you? Do you take Christ as your wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption? And are you satisfied to be shut up to this result, to have no other resources, no other dependence for happiness or security now, and forever? How delightful is the simplicity of faith! One object fills the whole field of vision. One exercise engages the soul­ trust — simple trust for all you want, so that you may both 'reckon yourself dead indeed unto sin,' and 'ALIVE UNTO GOD, through Jesus Christ our Lord!'"

## Sanctification — Objections

1. **Do not many Christians object to this doctrine?** Yes: very strongly, indeed.

2. **Why do they object?** One reason is because the Christians whom they know do not themselves profess to enjoy it, and say positively that it cannot be attained in this life by anyone else.

3. **How do you prove this objection to be groundless?** By showing that what God has commanded and promised in the Bible is the standard of experience for Christians, rather than the attainments of His professed people. I am to measure myself by what God says, rather than by what His unfaithful followers do. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." — Isaiah 8: 20.

4. **But what does John mean when he says, "If we say we have NO sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us"? — 1 John 1:8.** This passage has two interpretations, and is applicable to two different characters:

    I. It means that if a man should say, as people frequently do, that he is not a sinner, that he has never done wrong, and has nothing to be forgiven, and therefore, does not need a Saviour's blood, such a man denies what every man feels in his heart to be true — namely, that he is, by nature and practice, a sinner, needing mercy; and, in this denial, he proves that he is self-deceived, and that the truth is not in him.

    II. This passage is also descriptive of, and applicable to, those who, while acknowledging that they are daily and hourly committing sin, yet delude themselves with the notion that their sins are imputed to Christ, and not charged to them. By this they mean that no matter how worldly, selfish, or even devilish they may actually be, their sins were so dealt with by Christ that they are not imputed to them, and that, therefore, while full of sin, they are WITHOUT SIN.

Actually, this doctrine is known as perfection in Christ; and it states that when God looks at His children, He looks at them through His Son, and cannot, or does not, or will not see their sins, neither does He take any account of them, nor hold them responsible for them; that He (God) looks at them not as they are, but as they ought to be, and deals with them accordingly. Now, John says, in this text, to those who hold these views, "If any man say he has no sin, when he is actually committing sin, or if any man imagines that when he commits sin it is not he that doeth it, but some other nature within him, and that God will not hold him accountable for it, or if, in any other way, he says he is not a sinner, when he is, he deceives himself , and the truth is not in him."

5. **But what is the true meaning of this passage?** The meaning has been already stated — that if persons say they are righteous, while living in known sin, they deceive themselves; but that, if they confess their sins, God is faithful to His promise of salvation, and just to His Son, who bought it with His blood, to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

6. **If all a man's sins are forgiven, and all his unrighteousness is cleansed away, will there be any left?** No: certainly not.

7. **Then a man so forgiven and cleansed is without sin?** Yes! Without sin.

8. **Can God keep him without sin?** Yes! He has promised to preserve him blameless to the day of His coming.

9. **What other objections are made to this doctrine of Holiness?** Objectors say they have never seen a holy person — that is, one who lives without sin.

10. **What reply would you make to this?** I should say —

    I. That I was afraid they had not chosen as their associates those who believed in the possibility of being holy on earth, and, therefore they were not likely to meet with many who enjoyed it; and —

    II. I should say that I was afraid that, if they had met with a sanctified soul, their prejudices had prevented them recognizing him as such. We see the power of prejudice in the case of the Scribes and Pharisees, who, when they saw the Saviour, who, unquestionably, was without sin, yet said of Him, "He hath a devil."

11. **When people say, "Show me a holy person, and then I will believe the doctrine," what do they usually mean?** They are generally influenced by the same feelings as Herod, who sought the young Child, Jesus, not to believe on Him, but to kill Him. If you presented them with the very character they asked for, their first business would be to pull him to pieces.

12. **What is the best advice to give these and all other objectors?** Recommend them to make the full consecration of themselves to the service of God, promising to obey whatever light He shall give them; they can then rest assured that the Holy Ghost will lead them into the truth on the subject.

This comprehensive catechism on holiness from April 1881 represents one of William Booth's most systematic theological statements. Written during the early years of the Salvation Army's formal existence, it reflects the movement's distinctive emphasis on entire sanctification as a second definite work of grace. The question-and-answer format was designed for practical instruction of officers and soldiers, addressing both doctrinal foundations and common objections. Booth's teaching carefully distinguishes between "sinless perfection" (which he rejects as impossible for finite beings) and "Christian perfection" (perfect love within human limitations). The document reveals the Army's Wesleyan-Holiness roots while adapting these concepts for practical ministry among the working classes. The emphasis on total consecration, renunciation of worldly habits (smoking, drinking, fashionable dress), and immediate faith for cleansing reflects the Army's radical approach to Christian discipleship and its commitment to reaching society's outcasts through transformed lives.
