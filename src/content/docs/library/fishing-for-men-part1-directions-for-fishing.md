# Directions for Fishing

_From "Fishing for Men" by William Booth_

---

I find some difficulty in giving advice as to the discharge of this duty. It is as to the discharge of this duty. It is a work which peculiarly requires Divine guidance. It cannot be effectively performed without it, no matter what instructions the 'Fisher' may receive. Officers and Soldiers who are charged with this duty should go straight to the Throne of Grace and ask for that Spirit who alone is able to direct and make them successful, and not rest until they can believe for HIs reception.

Still, I cannot refrain form saying something of what I believe the Lord has taught me on this subject, and of those methods which I have learned by long years of actual practice on the Field.

## Mind Your Introduction

The 'Fisher' should be careful with his first question.

This is important, seeing that it is so very easy to shut up the heart and close the ear against any further appeal by a too abrupt or too familiar introduction. Sometimes — nay, very often — when men have been convinced during the service that they are wrong, the conviction will have created a nervous and irritable state of feeling that will necessitate a very careful handling if they are not to be driven from the building.

The attack should always be opened in a very gentle and respectful manner. Your looks, your manner, your earnestness, your character will all tell powerfully at that moment, and have much to do with your acceptance. All this will be determined very much by the state of your own heart. If that is full of sympathy, all else will be in keeping with it, and you will not go far astray.

To gain attention, and to be allowed to deal with an individual personally about his soul, and that at the beginning, is a great advantage, and often the forerunner of victory. To receive a refusal at the onset means probably being shut out from that soul — for that Meeting, anyway, if not for ever; and if they refuse to hear you, they will very likely refuse to hear any one else.

Thus, the 'Fisher' must be very careful with his first approaches, or he will simply frighten his fish away. In 'fishing' I have tried many different modes of address, and have; thank God, very often succeeded; and, alas, alas! have very often failed. The following hints may be useful:

## Get on Talking Terms

The 'Fisher's' first business is to get, as we have seen, into friendly relations. Especially is this important if the individual attacked is a stranger, or some one likely to resent any personal approaches, or to be easily offended. I have sometimes, in such cases, opened the attack by asking the person what he thinks of the Meeting, or of the singing, or the subject of the address, or of something else about the night's work, and have gone on to personal matters.

## When Really Awakened, Arguments Unnecessary

If there is any evidence that the person approached is wounded — that is, really convicted of his sinfulness — little introduction is needed.

Go straight for decision, and you can often command it by saying, 'Come away.' I have taken hundreds of souls, thus wounded, by the hand and led them to the mercy-seat, without saying a word, or not more than 'Come away.'

If the 'Fisher' knows the character of the individual, the way is tolerably plain. That is, if he knows that he is a Backslider, or a Sceptic, a Drunkard, a Pharisee, an Unconverted Hearer, or the like, his way will be straight before him. Under such circumstances, it is a great advantage to the 'Fisher' to let the person know that he is aware of his religious condition. He can then at once appeal to him in his true character, and ask if he has any desire to be saved.

## What Question to Ask

If the person approached is a stranger, of whose condition the 'Fisher' has no knowledge, then he must act very carefully. His first business is, as we have seen, to get on speaking terms. This done, he may then proceed with the attempt to discover whether the individual is saved or not, and this sometimes is a difficult task. Men and women who are strangers to Salvation Army plainness of speech on these matters are naturally averse to opening their hearts to a stranger, and being criticized in public, as they regard it.

Forty-nine years ago I commenced dealing with anxious souls by asking the question, 'Are you happy?' And when a great Awakening is in full swing, and people are made to look their spiritual condition fairly in the face, the question answers well, because the Spirit of God, by revealing to the sinner his condition, and keeping it before his mind, produces a state of discontent and corresponding misery within him which he cannot shake off.

But in times of indifference I am not sure whether this question would serve your purpose. If nothing as the following:

Are you saved?
Have you got this matter settled?
Are you living to please God?
Are you ready for eternity?

The subject of the address just given will often suggest questions which may be asked with good effect. For instance, if the talking has been about Christ knocking at the door of the hearts of sinners, the question may be asked, 'Have you let Jesus in?

If the topic has been Death, you may ask, 'Are you ready to die?'

If the topic has been the Great White Throne, or the Judgement Day, you may ask, Are you ready to stand before the Throne?'

If the topic has been Holiness, you may ask, 'have you found this blessing of a clean heart?'

## You must Have a Reply

The 'Fisher' should, whenever possible, secure an answer to his question; that is, he would prevail upon those with whom he speaks to give him the information as to their religious condition for which he asks. Sometimes people will remain for hours under a fire of questions without answering a single word.

The reasons for this silence are not always the same. Sometimes they appear to be possessed of a Dumb Devil. Elijah closed his appeal to the Israelites with the questions, 'How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow Him: and if Baal, follow him. And the people answered him not a word.' The reason for their silence being, I suppose, that although they knew that they ought to serve God they had not made up their minds to do so, and therefore were silent.

I other cases they don't speak because their hearts are so full; they are afraid that if they do, their feelings will carry them away and break them down. They are opened to that, and so are silent.

And yet they must speak. Talking will be of very little service to them unless they will speak back again. How can they be advised unless their state of mind be known?

In all this, Officers and Soldiers whom the Lord has made to be 'Fishers' of men will be guided. If they have the Spirit they will not go wrong. Much, very much, also depends upon the influence of the Meeting. When a place is charged, as it were, with the heavenly electricity almost anything can be done with the people. Hearts will be like clay, plastic and mouldable in the hands of the servants and handmaidens of the Lord, and they will be forced into the Kingdom almost at pleasure. How great is the responsibility of the 'Fisher' at times like this none can tell.

Sometimes I have succeeded with these 'dumb souls' by taking them unawares with a question respecting some topic distant from spiritual matters, and having once opened their lips I have had no further difficulty with them on that score. Sometimes a song, a prayer, or a strong act of faith on the part of those seeking their decision had gained the day; anyway, it is usually safe to conclude that the Spirit of God is at work in such cases, and, therefore, the 'Fisher' should be encouraged to go forward with the attack.

This chapter serves as practical instruction from William Booth on personal evangelism within the Salvation Army context. Written in September 1909, it reflects Booth's extensive experience in what he termed "fishing for men" - the art of personal soul-winning. The guidance emphasizes the delicate balance between spiritual urgency and human sensitivity, demonstrating Booth's understanding that effective evangelism requires both divine empowerment and practical wisdom in approaching individuals about their spiritual condition.
