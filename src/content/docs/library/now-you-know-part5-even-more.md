## CHAPTER 43
### Built on Bedrock

Thirteen years ago, the storm surge from Hurricane Katrina caused Lake Pontchartrain's waters to top the levees in New Orleans at several critical locations—leaving 80% of the city under water. Along the lake's southern shoreline, the communities that lay below sea-level were not spared. The city was living a nightmare, as the subdivisions of Lake Terrace and Live Oaks, as well as the University of New Orleans, were all engulfed.

The Port Pontchartrain Lighthouse, however, survived. Orleans Parish officials claim the brackish water rose to half of the lighthouse's height. But a unique feature of this New Orleans landmark singles it out from other lighthouses that have been claimed by surges wrought by Category 4 or 5 hurricanes or through resulting beach erosion.

Authorized by the U.S. Congress at a cost of $6,000 to replace a simple 1832 wooden structure, the present lighthouse was erected of concrete and bricks. It was damaged during the Civil War, but it reopened in 1863.

Like a stoic, immovable monument, Port Pontchartrain Lighthouse survived several catastrophic hurricanes that hit New Orleans over the 160 years that followed. The 1869 hurricane carried away the station's kitchen, capsized the cistern and destroyed a plank walkway that led to a passenger-railroad wharf. However, the main dumbbell-shaped lighthouse structure defied the storm's highest tide.

Another challenge came with the 1893 hurricane—and a 15-foot surge that killed an estimated 2,000 people. What few survivors there were can be credited to the heroic efforts of Ellen Wilson, who was among the nation's first female lighthouse keepers. She took in countless neighbors into the safety of the lighthouse during that storm's worst.

The 1915 hurricane brought what many weather historians consider the most devastating storm surge to hit the New Orleans area until Katrina. Winds of well over 100 mph tore across the region for more than 15 hours. Even with this prolonged punishment, the lighthouse stood firm.

Hurricane Betsy (1965) was considered a rehearsal for what residents could expect if a more powerful storm with a more direct hit were to strike. The lighthouse weathered Betsy easily.

But it was Hurricane Katrina that gave this lighthouse its greatest test. And it was Katrina that proved the foresight of the U.S. Congress some 170 years ago to build this lighthouse on bedrock.

Actually, much more than the lighthouse depends on bedrock. All of us, in every pursuit of life, need bedrock.

One of the first lessons any child learns in Sunday School is the parable Jesus told about building your house upon the rock (Matthew 7:24-27). Every structure must have a sure foundation, or it will not last.

Hurricane-force winds will come into every life. The question is, are we prepared? Have we built our lives on the right foundation? For the believer, the answer is clearly Jesus Christ. Scripture teaches us in 1 Corinthians 3:11: "For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ."

The lighthouse has been a beacon for over 150 years and continues to serve boaters entering Lake Pontchartrain. Ships and boats of every shape and size safely navigate by its light. The lighthouse continues to this day because it was built on bedrock.

Similarly, our lives can be secure and can benefit others if our faith is built on the bedrock of Jesus Christ.

The Port Pontchartrain Lighthouse is testimony to an investment of the past that continues to pay dividends. Our faith will have the same reliability if it is built on bedrock.

## CHAPTER 44
### Diverging Paths

One of the most unlikely friendships in modern Christian history began when two young men found themselves as bunkmates at Wheaton College. Both were on fire for the Lord and felt strong callings toward evangelistic ministry.

Everything seemed to be falling into place for them to work together to win the world for Christ. They were the best of friends and seemed to share similar visions for their futures.

After all, both men were theological students working toward ministry that would be relevant around the world. Both were exceptionally bright and well-spoken. Both had strong convictions about the Gospel message. Both were deeply devoted to Christ.

But, ironically, a discussion that began during a long walk in the woods around their Christian college campus split these two young men onto diverging paths—two trails that would not intersect again for another 50 years.

Charles Templeton had growing doubts about the inspiration of Scripture. Many of the stories in the Old Testament seemed too far-fetched for a modern, educated 20th-century man to believe. Did God really stop the sun for Joshua? Was Jonah really swallowed by a big fish? How could Moses part the Red Sea?

His bunkmate, on the other hand, was not troubled by these questions. He had settled in his heart the issue of biblical authority and its divine inspiration.

"But, Billy," Templeton earnestly argued, "you cannot honestly tell me you believe that stuff as if it really happened!"

Billy thought for a moment and replied, "Charlie, I'm going to accept the Bible as God's Word by faith. I'm going to stop questioning and start believing."

That decision shaped the rest of Billy's life and catapulted him to fame as probably the most recognized evangelist in modern Christian history.

Templeton, on the other hand, could not get past what he perceived as conflicts between science and faith. He eventually left the ministry, became an agnostic and spent the rest of his adult life ranting against the claims of Christianity in newspaper columns, lectures and at least one book.

Later, when asked to compare his journey with that of his former bunkmate, Templeton told Christian author Lee Strobel, "I miss Him (Jesus). I miss Him every day." That statement became the concluding thought in Strobel's powerful book, The Case for Faith: A Journalist Investigates the Toughest Objections to Christianity.

There comes a time in every Christian's journey when we must decide whether we'll accept the Bible's authority, or use our own human reasoning to decide what to believe. Templeton chose the path of questioning, rationalization and doubt.

We know the rest of Billy Graham's story. A seemingly endless line of seekers have come "Just As I Am" in response to a simple sermon, faithfully preached by a man who settled the issue of biblical authority decades earlier. Graham never deviated from the simple Gospel he had preached in his very first sermon.

How different things could have been if Charles had chosen Billy's approach to faith. But perhaps the story isn't entirely sad for Charles Templeton. What if his agnostic writings served to strengthen the faith of Billy Graham and countless other Christians who read of his faithless arguments?

The path of questioning led to Templeton's alienation from the very thing he'd grown up believing could give life meaning, while Billy's path led to a "Purpose Driven Life" that reached millions with the Gospel.

It is highly likely that at least one person reading this account can be counted among the millions who've come to a saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, under the global ministry of Dr. Graham.

Until now, you were likely not aware of the once-close friend of Billy, who instead of becoming a "Pastor for World Leaders," chose instead the wrong road that led him to obscurity.

## CHAPTER 45
### Over My Dead Body!

Most Protestants know about Martin Luther, the great reformer who in 1517, turned Christianity on its head. Now that a full 500 years have passed since he nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of Wittenberg's All Saints' Church, it's good to take a closer look at an amusing twist rising from the flames of martyrdom.

But to do this, we need to set Martin Luther aside for the moment and take a look at another seeker of the truth, John Hus.

Interwoven in the lives of these two brave souls is a fact worthy of note, especially as we consider the recent quincentennial of the Reformation.

In the final minutes of his life, John Hus made a shocking prophesy—a word-play on his name, "Hus," which in Czech means "goose." And in doing so, he foretold the arrival of a "swan," who would prove to be a cataclysmic force against the corruption that had progressed within the Catholic Church for centuries.

"You may burn this 'goose,' but in a hundred years, God will raise up a 'swan,'" he proclaimed. Hus went on to declare that the swan would bring about reform that would be inescapable.

With that, the fire was lit, and Hus was burned alive. His prophetic threat was aimed directly at Johannes Zachariae, a powerful friar considered responsible for Hus's martyrdom.

Legend has it that when Hus made his prediction concerning the rising of a swan to usher reform to the Church, Zachariae sneered in response, "Over my dead body!"

Some 100 years later, Zachariae was long-dead; his bones had been interred in an altar in an Augustinian monastery located in Erfurt, Germany. Novice monks taking their priestly vows had to prostrate themselves over the altar beneath which, coincidentally, Zachariae slept in death.

The young adherent, Martin Luther, naturally accepted this rite of passage—this being long before his growing convictions of the Church's abuses against common people seeking salvation.

During the ceremony, the monks were asked, "What seekest thou?" They answered, perhaps in unison, "God's grace and mercy."

The rigors of the priesthood were then listed plainly and irrevocably before their vows were made by each one lying down over the altar. The rigors included: a renunciation of self, scant diet, coarse clothing, unending labor, poverty, shameless begging and the unsavory life of a cloistered clergyman.

God willing, Luther promised to endure these for the rest of his days—all in a desperate plea to find God's grace and mercy and thus escape Hell's damnation.

As each new priest made this symbolic transformation, the choir sang, "Hear, O Lord, our heartfelt pleas and deign to confer Thy blessing on this, Your servant. May he continue with Thy help to be faithful in Thy Church and merit eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." The ceremony continued with Luther exchanging his civilian clothes for the scratchy priest's habit.

These proceedings were music to Luther's ears. He had sorely struggled with Anfechtungen, which is the German word meaning a paranoia over alienation from God.

Of course, Luther eventually conquered that fear when later in life, he would realize through the Holy Spirit's revelation that we are justified by faith (Romans 1:17, for instance). He would grab the hammer and boldly nail those Ninety-Five Theses for the entire world to see—even if it meant his death!

Now you know how a tide-changing event would lead to our Salvation Army's existence today!

Ever since that pivotal day in 1517, the symbol of a swan is associated with Luther and the Reformation that followed—finally revealing in the blazing light of day that faith in Christ alone leads its every believer into the Kingdom of Heaven.

## CHAPTER 46
### Sam Houston's Best Friend

We have quite a few colorful characters in our nation's history, and certainly among them is General Sam Houston. Ask anyone from Texas about Sam Houston, and you are bound to get a response of pride and patriotism.

Admittedly, for most of his life, Sam Houston had quite a reputation—and for the wrong reasons. So bad was his drinking and carousing that Native Americans who knew him had a special nickname for him—"Big Drunk."

But in the last decade of his life, Sam Houston "got saved." How he came to be born-again, and who it was that led him to Christ—well, that is our Now You Know chapter this time around.

Sam Houston was the only person to serve as governor of two states (Tennessee and Texas). His stoic leadership through the dark days of massacre at the hands of the formidable Mexican Army at The Alamo and at Goliad proved critical to the cause of Texan independence.

Houston's brilliant strategy at San Jacinto defeated the barbarous General Santa Ana and won for Texas its status among the world's family of nations as a republic. Houston even served as President of the Republic of Texas for several years.

Among Houston's inner circle was his best friend for most of his adult life, Rev. George Washington Baines. It was Baines whose Christian influence was so profound on Houston—even during Sam's rough and rowdy years—that it finally brought the "Father of Texas" into a liberating life in Jesus Christ. From his day of conversion in 1854, "Ol' Sam" lived as a devout Christian until his death in 1863.

Now, it turns out that this would not be Rev. Baines's only connection with a bona fide head of state. Yes—Rev. Baines was named after our nation's first president, George Washington. But there would be another political connection to Rev. George Washington Baines far into the future.

A century later, a future president was born in a modest home in the hill country of Texas—grandson of the very man who led Sam Houston to the Lord.

That future president was Lyndon Baines Johnson—the 36th Chief Executive of these United States. But more importantly, LBJ was the grandson of the man who led the Father of Texas to Christ!

## CHAPTER 47
### Shipwrecked Church

There's a most interesting church on one of the shores in George Town, Grand Cayman. If you know anything about the Cayman Islands, you'll know that there are two major industries that make their economy tick.

Perhaps the most unique point about this little church is its origins.

The Port of Georgetown in New Orleans is remarkable both in its setting and architecture. It has a unique location right on the Caribbean Sea, and there are two major industries that run the economy. The massive tourist industry is big business. But to most of the Christian world—especially those of us in the banking for money laundering.

Because of its design, described by a naval architect, it resembles an inverted hull of the wooden ships that frequented this port for nearly 200 years. In fact, the mahogany beams were salvaged from wrecked ships and are a primary reason for the building's structural strength and its ability to survive countless hurricanes.

Enhancing are two stained-glass windows behind the platform. One depicts the risen Christ on Easter Sunday, and the other shows Jesus Ascending into Heaven.

Attached to the walls, on either side of the platform, are memorial plaques of church members lost at sea over the past 150 years. Among them are teachers, lawyers, ministers, clergy and fishermen lost at sea.

The bell-fry's bell is rung on New Year's Eve and special occasions each year. Several members of Great Britain's Royal Family, including the Queen, have worshiped there.

But this church is still growing by adding congregations from each of the neighboring islands for us a stirring irony. In an age when many Christian churches suffer from division and separation, residents on this island bind together—three formerly separate church families all call this their home.

The real irony is that this church was built between 1855 and 1856 by the Presbyterian Church in Jamaica in their attempt to send missionaries to Africa to preach and plant churches. The first stop on their long itinerary was supposed to be Nigeria. They never made it.

Their ship wrecked on the reefs just off the Caymans. Fortunately, the missionaries survived, and they came ashore and found indigenous people who had no church.

No Christians had made it there to establish a church of any kind. To these Jamaican missionaries, it was a redirection from God. "Why go all the way to Africa when we need to plant churches here in these neighboring islands?" they reasoned.

And so it is that a literal act of God brought Christianity to the Cayman Islands. Were it not for a hurricane that shipwrecked a group headed halfway around the world, some years—perhaps decades—would have gone by before Caymanians could benefit from the Gospel.

## CHAPTER 48
### Thanksgiving as We Know It

In October 1863, no idea to snub the Confederacy became a little-known reason why Thanksgiving is now a national holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of each November. It is an ironic event in our nation's history for which we, as Americans, can all be thankful.

It's true that Thanksgiving was already well-ensconced among Americans by the time the Civil War broke out, but the actual date each year was decided upon by each state in the North and South. U.S. Secretary of State William Seward made his way to the White House on that autumn morning with a snarly proposition for President Abraham Lincoln.

"They say, Mr. President, that we are stealing away the rights of the states. So I have come today to advise you that there is another state right that I think we ought to steal," Seward is purported to have said.

More out of curiosity than of spite, Lincoln asked, "What state right?"

"The right to name Thanksgiving Day!"

The holiday was already being designated on different days in different states. Wouldn't it make sense to have a single, fixed date for the entire nation—North and South? Besides, Seward intoned, this presented itself as a golden opportunity for a tongue-in-cheek poke at ol' Jeff Davis.

While we cannot say with certainty that Lincoln proceeded the way he did for Seward's reasoning, we are certain that Lincoln recognized neither the legitimacy of the Confederate government, nor of Jefferson Davis as a president of any kind. Lincoln maintained his assertion that all 35 states (USA and CSA) continued to form the Union. His philosophy throughout the conflict—malice for none; charity for all.

It is much more likely that President Lincoln saw this proposal as a means of healing the nation's wounds, rather than pouring salt on them. It certainly would also be a call to national prayer for God's countless blessings—yes, even in the midst of a great Civil War.

That fall, our nation had precious few reasons to be encouraged. History marks the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July as the turning tide of the war in favor of the Federals and the beginning of the end for the Rebels. But both battles came at terrible costs.

Meanwhile, enraged by draft laws and emancipation, citizens in several Northern cities started riots.

On a personal level, the President and the First Lady, Mary, were grieving over the loss of their son Willie.

And so, President Lincoln issued his Thanksgiving proclamation—not to hurt but to heal—setting the annual observance for the last Thursday of November. That presented no problem until 1939, when the country was still in the throes of the Great Depression and the last Thursday was a rare fifth one that November. Sensing the outcry of retailers for the shortened Christmas season, President Franklin Roosevelt moved it up to the fourth Thursday, and Congress permanently passed the change into law two years later.

And so, it is that the holiday many of us cherish as a favorite—a uniquely American tradition—was fashioned, hopefully not for a bitter swipe at a mortal enemy but as a gesture of patriotism and thankfulness to Almighty God expressed by countrymen soon reunited.

It is a story for the ages.

## CHAPTER 49
### Their Daughter Was a General

In 1920, Anna Mae McCabe was born to Majors Daniel & Manie McCabe in Buffalo, New York. Little could anyone know then what this middle child of Salvation Army officers would someday achieve.

Anna Mae dreamed of becoming a nurse when she grew up. In 1939, she enrolled at the Allentown (Pennsylvania) General Hospital School of Nursing, graduating in 1941 with a diploma in nursing. With the onset of World War Two, she joined the U.S. Army Nurse Corps and was sent to India to serve with the 20th Field Hospital.

The hospital was situated at the entrance to Ledo Road, which cut through the jungles into Burma. The buildings were made of bamboo. Dysentery, leeches and snakes were common, especially during monsoon seasons.

While she worked in the malaria-infested China Burma India Theater, she commonly treated gangrenous patients who were building the roadway to enable the Allies in their war against the Japanese. At one stretch, she came down with malaria, and while in hospital herself, she noticed a cobra under her bed. She calmly ordered a guard to shoot it and afterward said, "When one lives in the jungle, one can expect that sort of thing."

When the war ended, she worked at hospitals in Fort Dix, New Jersey; Phoenixville, Pennsylvania and Fort Myer, Virginia. But her nursing during peacetime here in the States was short-lived when the Korean conflict erupted.

Anna Mae was deployed in 1950 to the 4th Field Hospital in Inchon. She later described conditions at the hospital as "worse than those in India, because of cold temperatures in the operating room and a severe shortage of supplies."

In the 14 months of her service in Korea, Anna Mae and six other nurses mended some 25,000 wounded and sick soldiers and sailors. Away from her duties, she assisted chaplains by playing a field organ for church services which were often held near or at the front lines.

A few years after that war's unofficial end, Anna Mae met and married William A. Hays. Major Hays was transferred to Tokyo Army Hospital and later came stateside to continue her U.S. Army nursing career at Fort Sam Houston, Texas and Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, DC. During that time, she was selected as one of three private nurses for President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

By the time the Vietnam War was at its bloodiest, Anna Mae Hays held the rank of Colonel. In Vietnam, she supervised 4,500 nurses whose robust use of antibiotics, whole-blood transfusions and speedy helicopter evacuations helped improve chances of survival.

There is no doubting that Anna Mae's parents would have been extremely proud of their daughter, who spent her life nursing our nation's finest through three bitter wars. But we can also be sure that at least one more fact of her life would have given the McCabes a measure of pride: since 1970, Salvationists everywhere have been able to point to one of their own as the U.S. military's first female general.

Soon after attaining such a high rank, General Anna Mae Hays ran into Kitsy Westmoreland, the wife of General William Westmoreland (Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army from 1968-1972).

"I wish you'd get married again," Kitsy said to her friend.

When General Hays asked why, Kitsy snidely replied, "I just want some man to know what it's like to be married to a general!"

General Anna Mae Hays paved the way for equal treatment of women in the military, countered occupational sexism and made a number of landmark recommendations that were eventually accepted into military policy.

So, during the months of May (Memorial Day) and November (Veterans Day), when we pause to remember millions of sacrifices made by U.S. veterans over the past 250 years of our nation's existence, be sure to keep in mind this remarkable connection to our beloved Army, now that you know!

**Historical Context Note:** This fifth section, "Now You Know: Even More," presents seven additional remarkable stories that showcase the breadth and depth of The Salvation Army's connections to history, faith, and human experience. These diverse accounts span from natural disasters to theological reformation, from presidential families to military service, demonstrating how Salvationists and Army principles have intersected with pivotal moments across centuries and continents. The stories reveal how divine providence works through both dramatic events (like shipwrecks redirecting missionary work) and personal decisions (like Billy Graham's choice to accept biblical authority), while highlighting the Army's role in nurturing individuals who went on to achieve greatness in their fields. From the bedrock foundation of faith illustrated by the surviving lighthouse, to the first female Army general who broke military barriers, these accounts remind us that The Salvation Army's influence extends far beyond its direct ministry, touching the lives of leaders, reformers, and ordinary people who shape the world around them.
