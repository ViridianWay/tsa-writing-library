# The Blood of the Lamb
## II

_From "The Founder's Messages to Soldiers" by William Booth_

---

Comrades and Friends, — In my previous Message on this subject I dwelt on the all-important truth, that the sacrifice offered by Jesus Christ on the cross made it possible for God to deliver every man from the guilt, power, and consequences of his sins, and to do so in harmony with the dignity of His Person, the maintenance of His law, and the welfare of mankind.

In this Message I want to consider the subject a little more carefully, and to again invite you to seek with all your hearts the enjoyment of the priceless blessings provided for you by this manifestation of the Father's love.

In order to make myself better understood, I will again fall back upon some of the principles underlying the doctrine of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

**I. –And, first, I would remind you that all men are subjects of the Divine government.**

That is, we are all under the rule of Jehovah, our Sovereign Lord.

1. And just as earthly governors impose laws upon their people for the maintenance of order and the promotion of the general good, so God rules His subjects by specific laws and regulations.

2. To maintain respect for these laws, and secure obedience to them, certain penalties are imposed upon those who break them. Laws that had no punishments connected with their transgression would not be laws at all. They would be neither more not less than so much good advice, and consequently little or no notice would be taken of them by those for whose benefit they were made.

3. As you will know, men have broken these laws, and thereby exposed themselves to the penalty imposed by God upon their transgression. That penalty is everlasting punishment.

**II. – Now, the object God had before Him in giving His Son to die for the world was —**

1. To save men from this terrible punishment to which they had exposed themselves by the transgression of His laws.

2. Having forgiven their sins, and saved them from the consequences of their transgression, God seeks to induce them to live good, obedient, and useful lives on Earth.

3. God further planned to prepare them for a life of everlasting purity, joy, and worship in Heaven.

**III. –By the sacrifice of Jesus Christ each of the three following objects was gained:**

1. On the one hand, God showed to all the inhabitants of Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, the importance of His laws, and the awful results consequent on their transgression.

2. While maintaining the importance and value of these laws God was enabled to pardon, sanctify, and take to His bosom all who repented of their sins, returned to obedience, accepted His mercy, and believed on His Son.

3. And, further, by opening this wonderful way of Salvation, God revealed, as He could not possibly have done in any other way, the depth of the pity and love of His Heart towards sinful men.

**IV. What is your experience, my Comrades, in respect to this all-important subject?**

It is your immortal soul that is at stake.

God has, by the mightiest sacrifice possible, done His part in the transaction. I defy any being in this or any other world to say how He could have done more to bring about your Salvation consistent with His honour and the welfare of the universe.

Now, you must take up your share of the effort. Your destiny is in your own hands. You can write your name in the Book of Life, if you will. If it is not there it will be your own fault.

**V. –Let me show what you have to do in order to be made a partaker of the inestimable blessings flowing out of this stupendous sacrifice.**

1. You must know something about its nature. The more the better; but a very little will suffice if you have not the opportunity of learning more. The dying thief made the little he knew go a long way, it transported him to Paradise.

2. You must believe with your heart what you know with your head, whether much or little, about the sacrifice of the cross and the benefits it offers you. Never mind any difficulties that may cross your mind. Laugh at them. If you will but believe you shall see the Salvation of God.

3. You must duly appreciate the value of the blessings promised by the cross, and the agony it cost to purchase them. All Heaven stands aghast at the shameless, cold-blooded indifference with which the men and women for whom Christ shed His Blood regard the suffering it cost Him.

4. You must turn your back, without a regret, upon your wicked ways and sinful companionships, and cast yourselves at the feet of the God Man who made this mighty sacrifice for you.

5. You will then receive unto your soul the inestimable virtue flowing out of the sacrifice made for you; and it you will only obey the words of your Lord to the end, you shall have the inestimable honour of fighting for Him on earth and reigning with Him in His glory in the Skies.

By the grace of God, you shall meet there.

Your affectionate General,  
William Booth.

**Historical Context:**

This is the second part of William Booth's extended treatment of the atonement doctrine, building upon the theological foundation laid in Chapter 14. Written during 1907-1908 as part of his weekly messages to Salvation Army soldiers worldwide, this chapter demonstrates Booth's systematic approach to core Christian doctrines. The message reflects the Army's emphasis on both personal salvation and practical holiness, presenting the atonement not merely as theological theory but as the foundation for transformed living. Booth's use of governmental metaphors (divine sovereignty, laws, penalties) was particularly resonant in the Edwardian era, while his five-step practical application maintains the Army's characteristic focus on accessible, actionable spirituality for working-class converts.
