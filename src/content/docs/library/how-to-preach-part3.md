# How to Preach Part Three

_From "The Officer, No. 7, July, 1893. Vol. 1" by William Booth_

---

I closed last month with some general instructions as to the selection of a topic for the platform. In doing this I overlooked a consideration of considerable importance which should guide the officer in this duty. I failed to suggest that he should ever be ready to seize upon remarkable events which at the moment may be occupying the public mind; such as A Great Fire, A Mine Accident, A Notorious Crime, A Shipwreck, or any other similar occurrence. Such events will attract the multitude, command the attention of an audience from the onset, and from them any number of telling illustrations can be drawn. Officers should keep their eyes open, seize upon these passing occurrences, and use them to drive the truth home to the hearts of the people.

But we will suppose now that your topic is selected, and that the question arises: What shall I do with it? – which is a very important one.

When a subject is first suggested to my own mind it will often be all confusion. I am probably able to see something in it that is likely to be effective, but the difficulty is, now to get it into such a shape that my audience will understand its meaning, feel its importance, see its application to them, and be induced by it to act as I wish. Here is a difficulty, as I have already remarked, when this topic walks into my mind and takes hold of my imagination I cannot always at first sight see how it is going to be dealt with.

Very often after turning it over once or twice I am hopeless. The subject loses rather than gains upon me. The charm it had for me at the onset fades away and I dismiss it. But then it will come back again, bringing some new light with it as to its management, and seeming to say, "You must use me."

I then grapple with it, turning it over and over, thinking about it when I go to sleep, and when I wake, in the night, as I dress, in the train, and as I walk about. Gradually it beings to assume a possible shape; I get out my scribbling-book and write about it. Illustrations rise up to clothe it, and finally I am able to pour it out upon the people, and have the joy of seeing crowds of saints and sinners drawn to seek God by it.

I don't say that I always have this difficulty; sometimes, nay very often, a subject rises up all unsought, and unfolds itself without the asking. They will frequently be the case when I am otherwise engaged, and should always be secured at the moment by being written down in some sort of a note-book for further service.

But the question which I am now supposing to be asked me by an officer is, How am I to deal with a topic when I have got one? In other words, How can I present a given subject to an audience so as to produce the result I want? In trying to answer this question I don't forget that I am writing to cadets and young officers, and thus those of my readers who are old hands must not overlook the necessity I am under of giving counsels that may seem very elementary in their character.

In dealing with a topic, I think you will very often be much helped by proposing some simple questions to it such as the following:

I. What is the duty that is here commanded? or, What does the subject mean?

II. Why ought we to do it? What arguments are there in the Bible, in experience, in this world or the next, why this duty should be attended to?

III. How is this duty to be discharged? or, How is this experience to be gained? Or, How is this blessing to be enjoyed? or, What are the conditions which have to be performed before this blessing can be obtained?

IV. When ought this work to be done?

Now these and similar questions, which will readily occur to you upon a little thought will help you to see into a subject. They will also help to make it plain to your own mind and to the minds of your hearers.

Let me see if I can illustrate. Take any ordinary topic, such as Holiness, the Forgiveness of Sins, the Uncertainty of Life, Repentance, Faith, Judgment, Heaven, Hell, or any other and apply this plan.

We will take Repentance for instance. How will you deal with it? You will begin by asking the question, What is it? What does repenting of your sins mean? The answer will come to any cadet that Repentance must mean, among other things, –

(a) Feeling yourself a sinner
(b) Hating your sins and giving them up; that is, promising never to commit them any more.
(c) It must mean asking God for forgiveness and aid.
(d) It must mean believing that God means what He says when He offers to forgive you, and it must mean that such forgiveness is accepted with all the heart.

Then try the other question.

II. Why ought we to repent? And such reasons will come back as –

(a) Because it is so wicked to sin against a God Who is so good, so loving, and so compassionate.

(b) Because salvation is impossible without forgiveness. A father cannot forgive his boy who has been naughty, however anxious he may be to do so, until the boy sees his wrongdoing, and is sorry for it, and promises to do so no more. And just so it must be with your Heavenly Father, etc., etc.

(c) If sinners do not repent here, where forgiveness may be obtained, they will repent in eternity, where there will be no salvation. Then the officer may try the other question.

III. How must this duty be discharged? That is how must he repent? And the answer will come back –

(a) That he must look at his sins until he feels how hateful they are.

(b) He must go down before God, there and then, at the penitent-form or somewhere else, and confess them, and tell God he will give them up and accept salvation on the spot.

But, coming back, supposing an officer wants to improve some event, such as the loss of the "Victoria," of which the people's minds are so full at the present moment, I think it will help him if he asks some such questions as the following:

I. What remarkable feature does this calamity present?

II. What lesson does it teach? What is there to learn from it that has to do with the present and everlasting salvation of the people?

III. How can I by it illustrate and bring home to my hearers their present duty in relation to God, themselves, or their fellow men?

Now, I don't think any officer would find any difficulty in working out this plan, and the more practice he has the more readily will he be able to do so. Let him do everything in the spirit of prayer and dependence upon the Holy Ghost, and God will help him. He should always keep three things in view in all his preparation for the platform –

I. He should be careful to understand himself what he is going to say to other people. If he doesn't, how can he expect other people to understand him? He should think, and pray, and read his Bible, until all is plain to his own mind, and then he will be likely to make it plain to others.

II. He should illustrate plentifully. That is, he should compare the subject which he is endeavoring to make his hearers understand with some simple things of every day occurrence with which they are familiar.

III. He should apply everything as he goes along to the hearts and consciences of his hearers. He must drive home the truth or it will be useless. He must be continually saying,

**"YOU ARE THE PEOPLE WHOM THIS CONCERNS,"**

or they will put it from them and not feel that it means them. He should do this all the way through. He cannot afford, like the ordinary sermonizer, to make a long exposition and then have a little application at the close. He must go for the heart at every turn; but I shall have to refer to these points further on.

But there is a preparation beyond any mere gathering together of ideas, which appears to me to be of even greater importance than that to which I have already referred. In order to speak effectively of the things of the Kingdom, the soul of the speaker must be wide awake to their importance, and to the responsibility of the opportunity presented at the moment when he endeavors to speak on them. Men's minds and hearts go to sleep as truly as their bodies. Officers may be moving about and talking and acting outwardly, while the inner man is at least three parts asleep. The duty of dealing with men about their souls and the great realities of the eternal world are so immensely important, that every officer ought to come up with every faculty sensitive and active to the fullest extent.

Many officers who read this will doubtless remember wonderful times of liberty and power enjoyed on certain occasions in the past when great troubles had befallen them. They have gone to the platform feeling totally unequal to their task, crushed down and broken-hearted, feeling that they ought not to be called upon to the sacred business of comforting or saving or improving others while in such a condition of mind and heart. To their surprise, however, and the surprise of everyone around them, they have been lifted up above their own mournful experience and talked like angels form heaven. The reason has simply been that their souls have been properly woke up, and they have talked more effectively in consequence. Just as they would have done better in a business transaction when properly alive to the chance of making a good bargain, than they would when tired out and half asleep.

Here comes in one of the great benefits of prayer. Here is an indirect benefit of incalculable worth. The soul that rises up to wrestle with God for His blessing on a forthcoming effort, not only secures an answer in the direct pouring out of the Holy Ghost on his own soul, and the co-operating influences on the hearts of his hearers, but has all the latent energies of his own spirit roused up thereby. The inward perception he attains of Divine things, the sight of Calvary and the Judgment Day, and of heaven and hell, the blessedness of salvation, and the terribleness of damnation, all tend together to stir his whole being, and send him to the platform or the streets with every spiritual instinct all alive, and his whole nature full of nervous energy equal to every emergency.

Nothing is much better calculated to wake up the officer for his work on the platform than a good open-air fight. Direct communion with the outer world in the streets and drinking saloons will move the soul to its very depths. Hearing the crowd blaspheme his Master and curse his religion, and seeing the multitudes rushing down to hell, will bring him to the front ready to do the very best that lies in his power.

Some years back a Roman Catholic priest was moving all Paris by his powerful pathetic preaching in the great cathedral of Notre Dame. The people came in thousands, waited for hours, and groaned and sobbed aloud while he talked about the sufferings of Jesus Christ, the terribleness of sin, and judgment, and hell. The priest, prior to entering the pulpit, was accustomed to descend into the vaults under the cathedral, and was there, by his own choice and instructions, suspended by some of his colleagues to a real cross and beaten with rods for the space of half-an-hour in order that he might be the better prepared to speak to the people by some actual realisation of what his Master had suffered on their behalf.

Now I don't recommend any officer to follow this example with his body, but I do say that it would be good and profitable to him and his people that he should in spirit commune and sympathize and suffer with his Lord, and that he should go out and look at the multitudes who are perishing around him after the same fashion that his Master did, and by every possible method arouse his soul to the realisation of the solemn responsibilities devolving upon him in standing up between the living and the dead and delivering His message to dying men.

But let me come now to the officer on the platform, whether the platform be in the barracks or out of it. For all I have said or have to say has, and will have, I hope, an equal application to the work of talking to the people whether it be done indoors or out of doors. God forbid that I should leave the open-airs out of my calculations; for, so far as I can see, the great battles of the future will be fought in the open-air. Every day shows a greater indisposition on the part of the masses to cross the threshold of any building, whatever name it may bear, if they have any apprehension that the plain, burning truths which lead to the salvation of the soul are going to be spoken there. Therefore it follows, that if the people will not come to us, the greater is the necessity and urgency that will be laid upon us to go to them. And to them we Salvationists must and will go.

But to come back, then, I want to give some counsels that shall be more strictly applicable and more immediately useful to officers in speaking to the people. We will suppose he has got his message, at least some part of it.

## HOW SHALL HE DELIVER THAT MESSAGE?

I. Be natural in the way you talk. Be yourself, nay struggle to forget even yourself; that is, to lose yourself in the discharge of your duty. While you are thinking about yourself, or rather of what the people may think about you, or of what you are going to say next, or about anything but the salvation of the people before you, you will be hindered, if not actually disqualified, for your duty. Throw yourself into the fight regardless of anything and everything. Never mind what sort of a spectacle you make. Give yourself up to the task of securing victory, and you will be very likely to gain it.

Don't imitate anyone else, however much you may admire them, or however useful they may be. Even if you could acquire what is best in their manner of saying and doing things, it is very improbable whether you would be likely to be more useful than you will be in acting out your own original self. But imitators of other speakers in manner or voice are usually worse rather than better for it, seeing that they ordinarily acquire the most objectionable features of the person they copy.

In my native town at one time there was a certain minister who was very useful, and consequently very popular. Crowds flocked to hear him, and many souls were saved. There was also a certain local preacher there who also wanted to be useful, and who thought the best thing he could do to accomplish this was to copy this minister. Consequently he adopted his voice and manners as nearly as he could, and sallied forth to a neighboring village, dressed in his borrowed clothes. But the simple villagers were not captivated, and sent him a kind message at the close of the day to the effect that they did not like him nearly as well with John Smith's coat on as his own.

Talk colloquially; that is, naturally; just as you talk at the table or in conversation. Don't imagine that you have to shout or to use some sort of platform twang. It is astonishing how interesting some people are in private conversation, and how utterly uninteresting they become directly they mount the platform. This is largely because they go off into some unnatural way of speaking.

Talk with your tongue. Don't scrape your throat, or drag your words up from your chest. It is quite painful to hear some people rasp their poor throats, and pump their words up out of their stomachs until you expect they are going to roll over or go off into a fit. This makes killing work of talking, and no wonder that officers who have fallen into this habit are so soon exhausted. If you have contracted this method of speaking; and don't feel free with any other, of course you must go on it with it I suppose, for nothing must be allowed to destroy your freedom when engaged in your duty.

Talking in a natural manner is ordinarily a healthy exercise, and a man ought to be able, so far as the mere physical exertion of speaking is concerned, to be able to use his tongue without injury to himself so long as he can use his arms and legs. We see this to be so in the case of costermongers and other who sell their goods in the open air. They go on day by day, and usually thrive with their practice. Anyway, a reasonable amount of talking done in a natural manner is strengthening to the lungs and a preventative of consumption.

My dear wife had inflammation of the lungs almost every year until she commenced speaking, and I don't remember her having a single attack afterwards. But then she was a most natural talker, although very delicate, often speaking an hour and a-half, and sometimes two hours, in crowded and badly ventilated buildings and yet seldom suffering with her throat or chest in consequence.

Be natural with regard to what you say as well as the way you say it. Don't spout other people's compositions. Use their ideas and illustrations to any extent you think will be likely to be useful, but put them through your own mill first. Eat them and digest them with your brains. Take them in and deal with them much as you do your food, and then they will come from you as much alive as your own original thoughts and feelings.

Don't spout even your own compositions so far as mere words go. Things learnt off by heart and merely repeated are usually tame and insipid – but I have already, if I mistake not, said something of this description.

II. Talk to the people who are before you. Take in their characters as you mount the platform and your eye first looks over them. If you don't know them, enquire from those who do, and then go for them. Never mind what preparation you may have made, or what preconceived form of speech or service you may have thought about; there is your work. You have to influence, and move, and instruct those very people who are standing in that crowd and sitting on those seats looking up into your face. You have to make them think, and feel, and act in that manner which will please God and secure their salvation, and if possible you have to do it there and then.

Now look at them. It is not whether you can please them, send them away satisfied, get a good collection, induce them to come again; the first and foremost thing with you is to save and sanctify and inspire them with the burning love of Jesus Christ.

This is your time, my brother, my sister. Cry to God to help you, and look these people in the eyes and make them feel that you are speaking to them, and that you understand how they are fixed, what they are thinking about, the sins they are guilty of, the habits that bind them, the difficulties that lie in the way of their salvation, and the working of the great Remedy that you set before them.

Talk to them in as straight a manner as you would if you had them one by one in your own quarters, and was reasoning with them personally. To be able to do that is almost the perfection of preaching. No higher compliment was ever paid to preachers than that to which, thank God, we Salvationists are not strangers, and which speaks on this wise: "I went into the barracks a stranger to the officer on the platform and the people around me, but he seemed to set his eyes on me and to talk to me all the time, and in such a way that I felt sure some one must have been telling him about my past life." Oh, that is the talking of the heart to the heart!

**GO AND TALK TO THE PEOPLE.**

This third installment of Booth's preaching instruction moves from theoretical preparation to practical sermon development and delivery. Written for "The Officer" magazine in July 1893, Booth provides concrete methods for developing topics through systematic questioning, emphasizing the importance of spiritual preparation beyond mere intellectual gathering of ideas. His reference to the HMS Victoria disaster demonstrates his advocacy for using current events as sermon material. The article concludes with practical advice on natural delivery and direct, personal communication with audiences, embodying Booth's conviction that effective preaching must engage hearts, not just minds. His anecdote about the Roman Catholic priest in Notre Dame, while extreme, illustrates his belief that spiritual preparation requires deep identification with Christ's sufferings and genuine concern for lost souls.
