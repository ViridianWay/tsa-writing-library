# The Workers in the Mission

_From "How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel" by William Booth_

---

Have, for the most part, been brought to God in the movement, or through its instrumentality have been raised up from a backsliding state to a new and quickened life. The reader will have gathered in the preceding narrative that, though they may lack the human polish and refinement which education gives, they possess that simple faith, love for souls, devotion to their work, tact and courage in the face of difficulties, and that power in prayer which are acquired in no earthly school, but which the Master can alone impart.

The brethren wholly employed in the Mission are genuine working men. One has been a blacksmith, another a navvy, another a policeman, another a sailor, and the remainder have been engaged in similar callings. Consequently, they can speak to the working man as belonging to the same class, illustrating their exhortations with their own experience. They know the life of a working man; they understand the temptations which specially beset his downward path; and they know the peculiar trials and persecution he has to encounter when his feet are turned into the way of eternal life.

They can fall back in all their appeals to the crowd on their OWN EXPERIENCE, telling how the Christianity which they urge upon others has changed the vile habits of their lives, renewed their hearts, made them happy, and given them a good hope of a world where there will be no poverty, toil, affliction, or death. This always tells, and is unanswerable. The crowd may not understand their theology, although that is simple enough; but they can understand and appreciate this.

Then they can not only fall back upon what they have themselves felt, and seen, and handled of the word of life, but THEY CAN SING. When a ribald, hooting, half-drunken mob gathers, rendering talking unintelligible; or where attention flags, or the crowd lessens, they can raise their voices to some simple, lively strain, and thus sing the Gospel, and so charm the multitude to listen further to the story of the Cross.

Again, THEY CAN PRAY. In the streets, surrounded by unbelievers and sinners of every grade, often have we seen the rude crowd quieted and solemnized — nay, making a sincere show of reverence, while the brethren have fallen on their knees, and in earnest, heart-melting, heaven-moving strains prayed for the salvation of the people standing around.

## Lady Helpers

In speaking of the workers, we must not omit to mention three ladies, who have given up their whole time to the work of the Mission without being chargeable to its funds. These superintend the sick visitation, mothers' meetings, distribution of relief and clothes, in addition to which they occasionally conduct public services, to which the Master has set his seal in precious and abiding fruit.

In addition to those whose time is wholly occupied in the Mission, there are a large number of persons who devote their leisure hours to the different kinds of service described in this report. At the commencement of the religious course of all the converts, we try to instil into their minds the conviction that they are to be soldiers of Christ, and that the fighting is to commence at once. And though, as in all Christian enterprises, many, by reason of the self-denial and persecution ever attendant on the work, grow weary, still a blessed residue remains, otherwise we could not sustain the numerous services carried on by the Mission. Verily, the Master will not forget this labour of love.

## Committee

It is now over three years since a number of gentlemen, belonging to different denominations, formed themselves into a committee to assist me with their counsel, and to take the financial oversight of the undertaking. Each member is fully conversant with the character and working of this mission, and will be glad to give every information to any person desiring it.

## Magazine

In order to furnish a medium by which intelligence could be regularly conveyed to our friends, and to furnish reading calculated to stir up our people to full consecration and activity in the Lord's service, a monthly periodical, now entitled "The Christian Mission Magazine," price One Penny, was started in October, 1868. About 2,750 are circulated monthly, of which number over 2,000 are sold. We have reason to know that it has been useful, not only to our own people, but to other Christians, leading them to adopt some of our measures, and to put forth more energetic efforts for the salvation of souls.

## Our Hymn Book

The importance attached to singing has been already noted in this Report; consequently a suitable Hymn-book from the beginning appeared very desirable, and not finding one containing a sufficient number of hymns imitable for the regular services of a congregation, and at the same time adapted to all the requirements of open-air and revival meetings, we prepared one. The book contains 530 hymns, and is sold, strongly bound, at 8d., and also in better bindings, and larger type. It is considered the best collection of the kind extant, and is very highly prized and freely used by the poor people.

## The Support of This Mission

Such work as we have endeavoured to described in this Report must necessarily be costly. Theatres and halls, indeed any kind of places in prominent situations, involve a high rental. Workers who can give their whole time to visit and preach continually are indispensable to effectual operations amongst the poor. THE ENTIRE COST OF CARRYING ON THE MISSION AT PRESENT IS ABOUT FIFTY POUNDS PER WEEK. Towards this sum the poor people themselves do something. This they ought to do. It would be wrong to deprive them of the privilege of giving their mite, and if they prize the instrumentalities that have been blessed to them, and are rightly instructed, they will cheerfully give of their substance, however small their contribution may be. THE OFFERINGS OF THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES AT THE VARIOUS STATIONS ARE NOW ABOUT SEVENTEEN POUNDS PER WEEK. Indeed nearly every station is paying all its working expenses, — that is, rent, gas, firing, &c.; in addition to which others are contributing towards the salaries of the evangelists who work with them. For instance, the offerings at Whitechapel average five pounds weekly, which is nearly sufficient, not only to meet the heavy ground rent and working expenses, but also to pay the two brothers employed there. Still, if this work is to retain its purely evangelistic character, going down to the lowest strata of society, it must be supported from without. Those Christians to whom the Master has entrusted wealth, but who lack opportunity to join us, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, in this death-grapple with the powers and works and agencies of darkness, are, we think, under the most solemn obligation to help us by contributing of their substance to sustain us in the fight. If brethren and sisters have voluntarily given themselves up to labour in this lazaretto of disease, this prison-house of crime, this pandemonium of sin, vice, and misery in order that they may rescue, heal, and save some of its wretched, miserable, guilty inmates, surely those who stand looking on in the pleasant world without, should be willing right cheerfully to send us wherewith to carry on the work of mercy.

As already intimated, we are thrown wholly upon God and his people for the support of this Mission. Though often reduced to great straits, and our faith at times severely tried, hitherto the Lord has always undertaken for us, and we believe He will continue to do so. The Balance Sheet at the close of the Report will show that during the past year £4,397 has been received for all the purposes of the Mission; and perhaps we may be allowed to state that every penny of this money has been spent in the most economical manner and in real missionary enterprise. The official and general management of the Mission costs a comparatively trifling sum; the secretary being the only paid agent in this department of the work, and even he has the very important charge of "The Children's Mission."

We invite our friends to

## Come and See for Themselves

At any date if they will write to us beforehand, we will arrange for some one to accompany them to any of our stations, or introduce them to any of the persons referred to in this Report. Many of our friends have done this and we cannot but feel gratified and grateful that their testimony has been uniformly to the effect that it is a genuine work of God, far exceeding in magnitude and interest the expectations created respecting it by what they had read and heard beforehand. Of these testimonies we cannot help referring to that which is appended by the Editor of "The Christian" to the preface of this report.

## The Funds

The wishes of friends respecting the appropriation of their offerings and the exigencies of the mission, have led us to form the following separate funds.

### Fund for the General Spiritual Work

This money is applied to the salaries of evangelists, the rents of theatres, halls, and the general expenses of Mission work.

### The Building Fund

With this we assist stations to secure halls for themselves, and so save the enormous outlay required to rent them. We only propose to erect the simplest and plainest structures. Four unplastered walls, with ceiling and floor, doors and windows, a few forms, and a platform, are all we desire. Whenever a people want a place, they will gladly raise some little among themselves and their neighbours, and with this fund we propose to help them to the attainment of their object. Then, instead of all their little offerings being swallowed up in rent, they will be in a position to bear their full share of the working expenses, and to plant the Mission banner in some adjacent neighbourhood as dark as their own. The property thus acquired will be legally settled in trust for this kind of work for ever.

### Fund to Assist Destitute Saints

With this we assist the members of the Lord's household when in affliction and adversity.

### General Poor Fund

With this we help the poor indiscriminately, the only conditions being want and misery, striving to help those first who need it most, giving therefore always the preference to the afflicted.

### Our Own Support

This topic having been noticed in former reports, seems to call for a passing remark here. As stated on former occasions, the fund for this purpose has never been taken out of the moneys contributed for the support of the mission, a few of our personal friends having united to sustain us independently of the work. The necessity for this generous arrangement has, however, we are thankful to say, all but ceased. The Master, in His loving providence, having opened a way, by which we have reason to believe our need will be supplied altogether independent of our ministerial and evangelistic work. Thus we anticipate the great privilege of laying ourselves out for God and the salvation of men, as freely and as fully as ever, although in no way chargeable to His people.

## How Our Friends May Help Us

Friends may help

### By Praying for the Mission

Here we reiterate the request made in a former report. Brethren, pray for us. Pray for the workers, that they may be men and women full of faith and of the Holy Ghost; for the measures, that they may be wisely designed and faithfully carried out; for the preaching of the Gospel, that it may be complete, truthful, and accompanied by the demonstration of the Spirit; for the relief of the sick and poor, that it may dispose them to seek God; and for funds, that the hearts of the rich may be opened to send money to carry on the work. Friends may assist

### By Offerings in Money

To meet the present outlay, and to assist in extending the work. Money may be sent by cheque or Post Office order to William Booth, 3, Gore Road, Victoria Park Road, London, E.; or contributions may be paid in the account of the Christian Mission, at Messrs. Dimsdale, Fowler, & Co., Bankers, Cornhill, London, E.C. Small sums may be sent in Postage-stamps. Post Office orders should be made payable at the General Post Office.

### By Offerings of Gold and Silver Ornaments, Jewellery, &c.

Many have valuable articles lying away utterly useless, of which we can readily dispose, and spend the proceeds in feeding and teaching the people.

### By Forwarding Cast-off Clothing

This is most acceptable. When too good or unsuitable for the very poor, we readily dispose of it to the best advantage, and expend the money in the purchase of what is required.

### By Collecting Among Their Friends

Neat collecting cards, brief summaries of the work, for general circulation, and copies of this Report for contributors; also

### Small Polished Offering Boxes

Suitable for the sideboards of our friends, will be gladly forwarded, free, to any address, on application.

### By Making the Mission Known

There are many who would regard it a privilege to help this work were they aware of its existence and character. Some of our friends, having been informed of the issue of this Report, have, unsolicited, subscribed for a number for private circulation. We shall be happy to supply our readers with any quantity, for this purpose, at half-price.

This concluding chapter provides invaluable insight into the organizational structure and financial operations of the early Christian Mission. Booth's emphasis on working-class evangelists who could speak from personal experience reveals his strategic understanding that effective ministry among the poor required ministers who shared their background and struggles. The detailed financial information—operating costs of £50 per week with local contributions of £17 per week—illustrates both the significant resources required for urban mission work and the genuine commitment of the poor communities being served. The chapter also documents the emergence of the institutional framework that would become the Salvation Army, including the committee structure, magazine publication, and specialized funds. Booth's invitation for supporters to "come and see for themselves" reflects his confidence in the authenticity and effectiveness of the Mission's work, while his detailed practical guidance for donors shows his practical approach to fundraising and resource management.
