## CHAPTER 16
### A True Knitting Yarn

There's nothing new about knitting clubs. Throughout the last century, women and men have joined knitting clubs in order to enjoy fellowship, to hone their skills and even to express their patriotism. Over a century ago, during World War One, "knitting circles" sprang up across Britain, Canada and the USA to stitch a unique contribution to the war effort. The Salvation Army was in the forefront of hosting such groups.

The "knitting circle" movement peaked during World War Two, especially in the United Kingdom. The May 3, 1941 edition of The Times (London) reported that 73,000 garments to date had been produced by Salvation Army knitting circles, of which there seemed to be "one in every town." One Salvation Army knitting club (not identified specifically by the article), however, had an additional distinction—making it an event of note.

Knitting circles sprang up as much for morale as for practical purposes. Only music rivaled knitting as a pastime to boost spirits both at home and abroad during both World Wars.

Parents, spouses and even children found knitting to be a constructive and practical way to connect with their loved ones who were "in the fight" far away from home.

As soon as hostilities began in September 1939, knitters who had busied themselves during "the war to end all wars" once again armed themselves with needles—not as weapons, but as instruments of compassion. This time, they were joined literally by thousands more knitters who were beginners and amateurs.

In his book Crown of Glory, Crown of Thorns, General Shaw Clifton cites a report from All the World (April-June 1942) that "... by mid-1942 a million articles of knitted clothing had been handled" in the war effort. "This figure doubled," the General adds, "within a further two years (as) the Army shipped goods worth £500,000 in 97,158 cases and 465 sacks and bales in 490 ships."

Gifts came from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, the West Indies and India. Not only did these Christian items keep soldiers, sailors and airmen warmer—it boosted their morale, as they received "a touch of home."

Knitters plied their yarn not only for their military folk but also for others who seldom heard from home at all. Even young schoolgirls knitted mittens, helmets, socks and scarves for those close to the fighting.

But it didn't stop at the front lines—many knitted for orphans and destitute families that had been bombed out or had lost family members in battle. Special depots were established to receive and forward the knitted garments for distribution in the UK and overseas. Beginner knitters made mufflers. Schoolkids made simple 9" squares that would later be sewn together into blankets. Even those who couldn't get the hang of "purling" could make simple bandages—18-20" lengths joined together in garter stitch with 100% cotton yarn.

Finally, this was a ministry to one's self as well—knitters confined to an underground shelter during air raids were often seen stitching away to keep their minds off of the deadly blitzkrieg above.

It's not uncommon to hear of a blind man or woman who mastered the art of knitting.

What you might find ironic, however, is that an entire circle of blind knitters bonded together for the expressed purpose of doing their part—freeing up precious resources needed elsewhere.

## CHAPTER 17
### Athens Angel

No one ever accused Mary Peacock of being a gambler. In that sense of the word, nothing could be further from the truth. Mary was a staunch Salvationist—always displaying the sanctification she enjoyed through the power of the Holy Spirit.

But on one occasion, she took a risk. What a risk it turned out to be. The stakes were nothing short of the future of The Salvation Army in her native Athens, Georgia.

Then again, she was certain that she was standing on authority of the power of God—and with that, she had nothing to lose and everything to gain. That, my friends, makes what happened to the Athens Corps back in 1942 a chapter in the Army's history of note.

First, a little history—The Salvation Army opened the work in Athens on March 12, 1916 and remained open until late 1916 due to America's impending entry into World War I. After that Great War, the Army in Athens reopened on February 23, 1919 at 205 1/2 North Jackson Street.

Thirteen years later in 1932, the first Empty Stocking Fund ever started here was organized with assistance from the manager of Gallant-Belk Company, a local radio station and Jack Martin, who was well-known in the Athens area as the voice of "Santa Claus."

The work in Athens went on reasonably well, despite the Great Depression. But another global war again threatened the Athens Corps.

In 1942, during World War II, The Salvation Army's corps officers were Captain Mary Highcheck and assistant Lieutenant Louise Landers. Captain Highcheck requested a leave of absence in order that she might do her part in the War effort by joining the WACs. Lieutenant Landers was needed elsewhere, and due to a shortage of officer personnel, The Salvation Army Georgia Divisional Headquarters was contemplating the painful decision of closing the work again in Athens.

The divisional commander felt he had no choice. A novel proposal presented itself in the person of a devoted Sunday School teacher, Mary Peacock. Why not approach this faithful soldier of the Athens Corps to carry on the work in the absence of available officers during this critical period?

What a sacrifice it must have sounded for headquarters to ask Mary to consider quitting her job at a hosiery mill and taking on the seemingly insurmountable challenge of keeping the Athens Corps alive—at least for the duration of the war. After all, this was still the Great Depression. The economy was still in shambles, and employment was never a given.

But Mary said yes. She was given two weeks to learn about the administration of The Salvation Army, and then she went to work.

At that time, The Salvation Army was renting three different buildings for their programs. The immediate need, Mary surmised, was consolidation, and she set out to secure one property for the entire operation.

There was a building on College Avenue which the city obtained because of delinquent taxes. She approached the city officials about this building, asking if the local government would give it to the Army. This was a bold move, to be sure, for a novice Corps Officer.

After all, all they can say is "no."

They did. She was told it would have to be put up for public sale, and she should come to the courthouse and place a bid. There was only one other person there to bid against her. This is when Mary took her great chance, based entirely on her faith in God.

Mary told her bidding rival that he was wasting his time, as she was sure the Lord wanted that building for the work of The Salvation Army. Incredibly, he left—leaving her as the sole bidder.

Mary bought the building "lock, stock, and barrel" for $25! The building became the chapel, living quarters and activities department. Later, Mary was also able to purchase a home for the transient lodge on Strong Street.

By the time Mary retired at the rank of Major a few decades later, she had become something of a legend in the USA Southern Territory and certainly in the Georgia Division. She had become a sterling corps officer who had drawn many people to the Savior.

Almost lost to the Army's rich history in Athens, Georgia would be this little-known venture of faith—when a young lass audaciously became not only the highest bidder for a property that would guarantee the presence of Salvationists in this college town. She became the only bidder!

## CHAPTER 18
### Branded a Christian!

Paulo was a gang member in one of Brazil's largest cities. Not only was he heavily involved in violence, but he had begun making money off drug abuse.

By God's grace, Paulo turned up to walk down the street where The Salvation Army Corps was holding a meeting. Outdoor evangelistic services, complete with stirring testimonies, a lively brass band and soul-full singing. Paulo couldn't help himself. Out of curiosity, he went inside.

He was skeptical about what he saw and heard, but the earnestness with which these people shared their testimonies, the genuineness that seemed to characterize their entire gathering so deeply to his heart. Before he could think twice about it, Paulo was kneeling at the altar—pouring his teenage heart out to the Lord.

That evening marked the beginning of healing for Paulo. But the scar he would soon bear for the rest of his life is a glowing example for us to witness.

Now a new convert in Christ, Paulo had much to learn about his newfound faith. His corps officer showed infinite patience with Paulo—lifting him when he fell and guiding him with love and counsel, until the battle was won.

Paulo came to understand what being "totally surrendered" to Christ really meant. He accepted his calling to Salvation Army officership. When the big day of his enrollment finally approached, Paulo asked the captain if he could have two of the "S's" to wear on his collar—like those the other soldiers wore. Undoubtedly, Paulo was aware that wearing the S's out in the open would identify him as a Christian. This would be particularly dangerous with his former gang mates.

Sure enough, on the first day he wore his uniform in public complete with S's, he showed up at the captain's quarters.

"The gang saw me with my S's on," Paulo explained. "They told me that if they saw me wearing my uniform again, they'll beat me up. What should I do?"

Breathing a silent prayer, the captain answered, "You have three options. First, you can take the S's off. Second, you can stand up to them and fight back. Or third, you can do what Jesus did—He let His enemies do their worst to Him and went on loving them!"

Late that night, there was a knock on the captain's door. There stood Paulo, his uniform torn and his body bloodied and bruised.

"I did as Jesus would have done," Paulo proudly said, despite his swollen face. "They beat me up, and I told them I love them just the same!"

That's when the captain looked closer at the mass of blood on Paulo's forehead.

"How did you get that terrible slash on your head?" the captain asked.

"One of the gang took out a knife and said to me, 'If you're going to wear those S's, I'll cut an S on your forehead that you'll wear until you die!'" Paulo said.

And that's exactly what happened. From that day forward, Paulo wore his "S" proudly—taking every advantage to tell others how he got it—and how Christ can redeem them too!

## CHAPTER 19
### France's First Convert

The year was 1881. Captain Catherine Booth and three intrepid lassie lieutenants hoisted the Salvation Army's flag on a makeshift pole. Together they dreamed of conquering France for Christ, and the surest way to victory was to attack at the very center of "freethought and unbelief"—Paris. They knew the going would be tough.

All limitations, they believed, would surely be overcome by their faith, which was more than enough to sustain them.

But the dream very nearly ended within a fortnight. They fervently preached the Gospel in the open air and in their rented hall in a seedy quarter of Paris known as Belleville. Day after day, they paraded and preached on the streets. Night after night, they held meetings and preached their hearts out before the crowds of roughs and laborers—but to no avail.

Not one single convert. Not one hopeful break.

That all changed during one memorable meeting, which started out as unpromising as any before. That night, the momentum finally swung in the Army's favor in France.

The circumstances that led to that drastic reversal of fortune qualify as an answer to prayer for us to consider some 140+ years later.

The Founder wrote a tender letter of encouragement to his daughter soon after Catherine arrived in Paris: "Oh, my heart does yearn over you! Nevertheless, I know you won't be easy in your mind until you have seen a few French sinners at the Penitent Form (Army terminology for the altar)."

After several weeks and scores of meetings without visible results, the small band of lassies opened the hall for yet another meeting.

But this meeting would be historic!

The usual crowd shuffled in—derelicts, drunkards, prostitutes and a large group of ouvriers (laborers) who showed up night after night as though they had nothing else on Earth to do, and this was their "free entertainment." The "congregation" fidgeted and heckled the Salvationists relentlessly. Someone in the rowdy crowd got up and began to dance.

The meeting seemed lost and out of control, until Captain Catherine cried out above the din, "Mes amis! I will give you 20 minutes to dance, if you give me 20 minutes to speak. Are you agreed?"

A tall, dark, handsome ouvrier named Emile, who seemed to be the leader, jumped up and said, "Citizens, it is only fair!"

And so, they danced. True to his word, Emile stood with his hat in hand, and when the 20 minutes had expired, he shouted, "Time is up, citizens! Now it is the captain's turn!"

The bargain was kept. Everyone sat down and listened to Captain Catherine as she preached the sermon of her life—perhaps on which the hopes of the Army in France depended.

And the crowd listened intently, not for 20 minutes—but for one hour and 20 minutes!

Now, it should be noted that despite their attentiveness, no seekers came forward to the altar that night. But one ouvrier remained after the meeting. And Captain Catherine Booth, sensitive to the Holy Spirit's leading, went to the back of the hall where Emile waited and spoke with him.

"Thank you for your help tonight," she said. "Have you understood what I've been saying?"

"I believe that you believe what you say," Emile replied.

"Oh! Of course, I believe what I preached," she said.

"Well, I was not sure before," Emile confessed, and then added, "Have you time to listen?"

"Yes, certainly!"

And Emile poured out his heart before the young captain—shedding his rough exterior and revealing a delicate soul in need of Christ's forgiveness.

That night, Emile gave his heart to Christ—becoming the Army's first convert in France. He was thereafter indispensable to Captain Catherine and the Salvation Army.

The Army in France grew. Within 15 years from that night, France had 90 corps and outposts, 700 officers, headquarters and four weekly papers. None of that would have been possible if that Salvation Army lass had not plied for equal time from a rowdy crowd of ouvriers and one of them had not spoken to her heart because he doubted her sincerity.

Emile became the first of millions of converts the Army in France has been praying for; and those prayers came in God's perfect timing.

What miracle are you praying for?

## CHAPTER 20
### General #3?

In the 150+ years of The Salvation Army's rich history, we've had 21 Generals. But in 1929, an epic crisis arose in the Army's highest levels of leadership—threatening to tear the Army apart and leading to its possible demise.

At stake was nothing less than the generalship of our Army. The agonizing deliberations provide us with a crossroads in the Army's history to remember.

The concept of the High Council was provided by the Founder in the Army's supplementary Deed of Constitution in 1904, solely to allow for the removal of a sitting General in the event that he/she became "unfit for office." Before 1928, the normal method of naming a new General—for whatever reason—was by the "sealed envelope" provided by the Army's 1878 Deed Poll. Between 1878 and 1929, the "sealed envelope" was employed only once—in 1912, at the promotion to Glory of General William Booth.

As expected, when the envelope was opened by the Army's counsel, the name Bramwell Booth was read—no surprise there. Bramwell was the first son of William and Catherine, and he had worked alongside his father as Chief of the Staff since the beginning.

Almost immediately upon his elevation to General, Bramwell legally had to produce a "sealed envelope" of his own. The identity of the name he chose will forever remain a mystery. The envelope was burned and unopened after the stunning conclusions in Britain's courts following the High Council's action.

And so, by the late 1920s an uneasy groundswell mounted for reform within the ranks. General Bramwell Booth's rapidly decreasing health finally brought a "high-noon showdown" to reality, thus triggering the unthinkable—a High Council to decide whether to replace an Army icon.

For a comprehensive and well-written account of those tumultuous months, please read General John Larsson's 1929: A Crisis that Shaped the Salvation Army's Future.

But for our purposes here, just consider these facts:

• The High Council sadly concluded that General Bramwell Booth's ill health would only worsen, and that for the sake of the Army's future, he should be relieved of command.
• General Bramwell Booth was allowed to retain honor and his rank during his remaining years on Earth.
• After several ballots, Commissioner Edward Higgins was elected the Army's third General.

So, what about that policy "sealed envelope"?

Three names most likely were all Booths and all women: 1) his daughter, Commissioner Catherine Booth; 2) his sister, General Florence Booth; and 3) his flamboyant sister, Evangeline Booth.

By far, Commissioner Catherine was considered just as likely to be the Army's third General as her father had been when elected to be the second many years earlier. Catherine had an impressive resume, and most importantly, she had a Booth "pedigree."

"Generalship" in the pre-1929 Salvation Army was accepted as being divine right—as it was for the Founder (William), and until 1929, as it seemed destined (or ordained) for his likely successor, Commissioner Catherine Booth—who lived to be 104!

Thus right, had Bramwell's daughter become General Catherine Booth when he died later in 1929, she would have been the international leader of The Salvation Army for a whopping 50+ years!

## CHAPTER 21
### Gypsy Boy

Rodney "Gypsy" Smith (1860-1947) was the Billy Graham of his day. Historians estimate that thousands on several continents were won to Christ through his magnetic preaching style and his winning personality. His trips across the Atlantic Ocean were so numerous that historians can't even decide on the exact number.

Gypsy Smith capitalized on his family culture. His parents and five siblings lived and traveled in wagons and tents, and this reflected the nomadic stereotype of Gypsies. Before his father was converted to Christianity, Papa could ply his violin at barrooms and pub houses, while little Rodney danced to the music. Dad (Cornelius) was the first to be "Gypsy saved." He was followed by Mom (on her deathbed), and one-by-one, Rodney's brothers and sisters, beginning with the oldest and working on down the line.

For 16-year-old Rodney's conversion, it took the witness of his father, the singing of Ira Sankey, a visit to the home of John Bunyan—and one more very important reason.

Once Cornelius became gloriously saved, there was no more fiddling at the public houses. Instead, Cornelius took his family on revival appearances throughout England. They were billed as "The Converted Gypsies." Crowds especially loved Rodney, who quickly became known as "the little Gypsy boy." People flocked to see them, if only for the oddity of seeing real Gypsies.

One day, William Booth (then general-superintendent of The Christian Mission) took note of the singing Gypsies, and in particular, young Rodney. He invited Rodney (at one of Booth's appearances) to preach on the spot. Rodney sang a song and gave his testimony.

Although Rodney didn't try to be funny, he connected immediately with the audience. On June 25, 1877, Booth invited him to be an evangelist for the Mission.

With The Christian Mission's metamorphosis into The Salvation Army the following year, Rodney was made an officer holding the rank of Lieutenant. He worked under the mentorship of such pioneers as Ballington Booth and Elijah Cadman. He served as a single corps officer in Whitby, Sheffield, Chatham, Plymouth and Bolton. While in Whitby, one of his converts was Annie E. Pennock, whom he later married.

Rodney and Annie went on to serve as corps officers together in Hull, Derby and Hanley. Most everywhere they went, numbers grew mightily. In Chatham, for example, the corps grew from 13 to 250 within nine months. Derby was the only place the Captains Smith encountered discouragements and opposition. It was during their post in Hull that the name "Gypsy" began to circulate.

Later in life, Gypsy Smith pointed to their time in Hanley as the most productive and memorable during his five-year career as a Salvation Army officer. For the rest of his life, he referred to Hanley as "my greatest battlefield."

In December 1881, General Booth asked Gypsy, "Where do you want to go next?" Captain Smith replied, "Send me to the nearest place to the bottomless pit!"

The little couple and their babies arrived by train in Hanley on New Year's Eve. As the train approached town, the many factory chimneys came into sight. They could smell the sulfur of the iron foundries and see smoke rising from seemingly everywhere.

"I began to wonder if I had not got to the actual place to which I had asked to be sent!" he later mused. Nevertheless, the work in Hanley greatly increased in success and fruitfulness. "From 6:30 pm on Saturdays to 9:30 pm on Sundays, we held nine services—indoors and out of doors," he recalled.

The Smiths and their growing band of soldiers sold up to 10,000 copies of The War Cry every week. "No other station in the Salvation Army has ever managed to do this, as far as I know," he later mused.

Unfortunately, Gypsy Smith and The Salvation Army parted ways in 1882—but his ministry as an officer in his eight corps produced an estimated 13,000 decisions for Christ, with crowds numbering in many places up to 3,500!

Gypsy Smith went on to become a world-renowned evangelist. His influence for God's Kingdom is inestimable.

But none of that would have been possible except for the real reason Rodney decided to accept Christ as a teen.

It seems that back then, in his family at least, there was a sort of pecking order to be saved in their little circle—a pecking order, of sorts. As Rodney's father, then mother, then older brother and sister accepted Christ as Lord and Savior, Rodney reasoned secretly that in order for his two remaining younger sisters to be saved—he first had to lead the charge.

All six Smith children entered the ministry.

"I must say that my love for [my dear sister] led me to [my own] decision for Christ, and God repaid me more than abundantly by making me a blessing to her!"

## CHAPTER 22
### His Army Family

Buried in an older part of Ashland Cemetery in Ashland, Ohio, is the solitary grave of one of our most faithful Salvation Army officers. Not much is known about Captain Friedrich Holzgrefer other than the scant information engraved on the obelisk erected by the soldiers of the Ashland Citadel Corps—the people he pastored for a couple of years before his death in 1904.

You might have to look hard for that information the obelisk holds. Originally engraved on all four sides, time and the elements have erased away the wording on all but one.

Friedrich was born in Germany in 1867. By the time he immigrated to the United States in the 1880s, The Salvation Army's invasion of America was taking hold. With the rank of Captain, he was assigned to Ashland around the turn of the century, where he immersed himself in the Army's mission and ministry.

He must have had experience as a carpenter, because word has passed down from Ashland Army generation to generation that "the Captain" built the original corps building downtown. It was a two-story structure with a chapel below and Captain Friedrich's quaint quarters above.

It is not known if Captain Friedrich ever married—much less if he ever fathered children. In fact, he apparently came to America, and eventually to Ohio, without a family. That fact is an almost-obscure nugget for us to uncover here in the 21st Century.

For someone so alone in life, Captain Friedrich had a way with people. He was a good pastor, and his band of Ashland Corps Soldiers steadily grew. Their love for him was evident. And they missed him at his routine one Sunday morning for worship, as he would normally greet his parishioners with a smile, a handshake and maybe a hug.

When the meeting was due to begin and still no Captain had emerged from his room upstairs, perhaps he was sick, or maybe he was overtired from the duties of the week?

Someone decided to venture up there and check. They found him. He had fallen asleep the night before, and during the wee hours of morning, he woke up in the presence of Jesus.

The simple words on his marker state: "Captain Friedrich Holzgrefer. At His Post." Succinct.

Official records for the Ashland Cemetery, in the space reserved for family connected to the deceased, for Captain Friedrich show no blood relatives known to Ohio, the line was filled by "The Salvation Army."

So it seems Captain Friedrich Holzgrefer had a family after all. At the end, he had his Army Family, and he's now realizing rapturous joy of Heaven as a bona fide member of the Family of God.

And another irony is also apparent in the locale. The man who built the first Salvation Army Corps in Ashland is located within a few blocks walking distance of the present 12-acre Kroc Corps Center made possible by two other dedicated souls, Ray and Joan Kroc.

The officers and soldiers of the Ashland Kroc Corps Community Center have much to be proud of with a center that has become the hub of that community. And they can also be proud of their heritage. The Ashland Corps pioneered by an immigrant who wanted nothing more than to be a citizen of Heaven, while working hard to take as many as he could eventually join him.

## CHAPTER 23
### Hitler's Broken Promise to the Army

Not until after Germany surrendered in May 1945 could the international Salvation Army reestablish communication with its Territory Headquarters in Berlin. For almost six years of agonizing silence, IHQ could only receive dribbles of news reports—via the Army in neutral Switzerland—of the atrocities perpetrated against German Salvationists in particular and the populace in general.

The Army in Germany was just beginning to recover in 1939 from the staggering losses suffered during World War One. Now, barely 20 years later, Salvationists in "The Fatherland" were about to face even worse with the onslaught of World War Two.

General Shaw Clifton's concise treatise on The Salvation Army's ongoing dilemma during three major wars, Crown of Glory, Crown of Thorns, states, "... the 1914-1918 war had decimated the [Army's] work, but sufficient recovery had been made so that by 1939 the German Territory could spare 40 Officers for service in 12 other countries, including missionary areas. [However] with the rise of National Socialism, curbs were placed on Army activity and on 14 February 1934 Himmler and Heydrich ordered that Salvationists should be restricted as much as possible."

There seemed to be a slight break in the storm clouds upon General Evangeline Booth's appeasing telegram to Adolf Hitler in October 1934, in which she cabled, "Please permit me to express my deep appreciation and sincere gratitude for your conciliatory attitude toward The Salvation Army in Germany ... I want our people to do their full part individually and collectively toward making a better Germany."

General Booth and German Salvationists kept the Army's promise; Hitler eventually would not. Our story is found in what followed.

From the German leadership after Hitler took power, at first, Hitler was taken aback with General Booth's December telegram and the Gestapo sent out the following order:

"The Führer has recently said that he was not opposed to those activities of The Salvation Army, which never engaged itself politically. Out of consideration of foreign policy he wants no action taken against them."

This appeasing strategy worked with the German Government, at least for about a year. Adjutant Erik Wickberg came into Germany from Sweden in late 1935 and reported that: "Throughout practically the whole of Germany, open-air meetings and indoor meetings are being held without interference. The Army's social centers remain staffed, and Göring sent Christmas toys for distribution at Salvation Army Children's Homes."

But by 1936, the wheels began to fall off: Göring disbanded the Army's Girl Guide (Scouting) groups, all youth activities fell under Nazi control, and when the burning of Bibles commenced, those belonging to the Army were not spared.

Der Kriegsruf (The War Cry) was banned, all youth work soon collapsed, and no public fundraising was permitted. The use of our military ranks was outlawed, Salvationists could not be called "officers" or "soldiers," and all Salvation Army property had to be turned over to the State.

(Lt. Colonel) Johann Büsing, the Acting Territorial Commander was informed that The Salvation Army in Germany was to be dissolved. When the Nazis ordered Büsing to hand over all Army institutions to local governments, to his shock and joy he discovered that most of the municipal governments were not "on board."

The reason? There was no one else around to run desperately needed programs to assist a populace that was growing increasingly hungry and destitute as the war dragged on. Ironically, most city and town councils asked the Army to keep going with its ministry and ministry!

## CHAPTER 24
### Ken, the Banjo Man

When General John Gowans, The Salvation Army's 17th international leader, was but a mere lieutenant, he was placed in charge of the East Hill Corps in Liverpool. It was there that Lt. Gowans learned an incredible technique in conducting open-air meetings—but of greater importance was the introduction of a banjo player named Ken to the Army.

The technique Gowans learned came from a Major William Slater, a seasoned officer who employed the strategy for most of his soul-winning career. It is simple, really: find a theater with a long line of patrons waiting to buy their tickets, and you have a "captive" audience!

Gowans and his band of soldiers selected a cinema near their corps, and for several regular weekly open-air meetings (multiple meetings on Saturdays and Sundays!), the Salvationists would play, sing and preach souls into the Kingdom of Heaven.

That is, until they met Ken.

Ken was a foul-mouthed, usually inebriated, but talented street musician who had a pretty good technique of his own. As he was proficient on his banjo, crowds enjoyed listening and singing along with his barroom songs and gutter talk.

It didn't take long for Ken to "muscle in" near the curb where the Salvationists launched their Gospel message. He even accused the Sallies of invading his territory.

You would think that the Sallies had the advantage, if only in numbers, but you'd be wrong. Lt. Gowans had two musicians on which he could rely—a boy fairly new on the cornet and an older baritone player way past his prime. Besides, Ken could play rings around them.

A compromise had to be reached. Gowans suggested to Ken that they "share" their audience and the 30 minutes or so both parties had before the theater patrons could file inside.

Ken could have the first 30 minutes, as long as the remaining time was dedicated to the Gospel. Surprisingly, Ken agreed—and even more surprising—the arrangement worked far better than Gowans imagined.

After a few weeks, Ken began playing his banjo along with the Army, remembering the old Gospel songs he'd learned as a boy.

He even finally accepted an invitation to come to the corps for a Sunday service.

During that following week, Lt. Gowans was doing some visitation, and he decided to pop in to see Ken. What Gowans saw broke his heart. Ken had only a box spring for a bed, and no dishes to speak of. The lieutenant soon brought a crew of his female soldiers to tidy up the place and make it look livable. He also secured furniture, dishware and a mattress on which Ken could now sleep in comfort.

The Christlike love shown by Lt. Gowans melted Ken's heart. He became gloriously saved.

Ken became a soldier of the East Hill Corps and was proud of wearing his uniform—especially to the open-air meetings. The people of the corps loved him, and for many years, Ken was an enthusiastic member of the Army he once opposed and cursed.

Ken is in Glory now. And the once foul-mouthed banjo player hawking shillings on a Liverpool street is now singing with the angels.

## CHAPTER 25
### Noble, but Sinful Blood

Nancy Malzoff had noble blood coursing through her veins. She was a princess—the daughter of an emperor. She was a friend of Edward VII, and her brilliant wit made her a welcomed part in every court in Europe. She spoke eight languages and proudly boasted herself that she had known everyone worth knowing and had seen everything worth seeing in this world.

But something changed one fateful night in Paris, when Nancy finally realized how utterly lost in her sin she really was. What happened to Princess Nancy that night qualifies her testimony as another proof of how God raises up The Salvation Army.

The Salvation Army was making great strides in France. Under the direction of the Founder's daughter, Catherine Booth-Clibborn, the Army had come from a hopeless ministry to a thriving and pulsating movement sweeping the country by storm. The Maréchale (marshal), as Catherine became affectionately known by the French people, was by this time something of a celebrity herself. Noted for her speaking ability, the Maréchale drew audiences among laborers and aristocrats alike.

That night, the Maréchale was to speak at the Hotel Meurice on the Rue de Rivoli. Princess Nancy wanted to hear and meet the Maréchale.

From the moment the Maréchale opened her sermon, Princess Nancy was fascinated. After the meeting concluded, they met and struck a friendship that was to last many years.

Princess Nancy belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church. She was married by age 16 and by age 28 had borne 11 children. When she found her husband unfaithful, she dismissed him with an emphatic "C'est fini!" and did not see him again for over a quarter of a century. The experience took a toll, leaving her bitter and empty.

The Maréchale listened sympathetically as Princess Nancy confided about her heart's emptiness and loneliness, despite worldwide fame. Although she had "noble" blood, it was nevertheless sinful, and Princess Nancy was desperate for salvation.

She did not want to hear what the Maréchale had to say—"If you want Christ, you must forgive your ex-husband. No matter what he has done; you must forgive him, if you would be forgiven of God."

"Never! Never!" Princess Nancy would insist for six months.

But the Maréchale was insistent—the princess must not only forgive, but she must do it in person!

"I cannot. I cannot," the princess agonized.

"Princess," said the Maréchale, "your sins are not his sins, but they are sins before God. If you want God to forgive you, you must forgive those who have wronged you."

The Maréchale prayed, urging the princess to remember Christ on the cross and how He forgave.

Not long after this encounter, a telegram arrived from Princess Nancy with this message: "Maréchale—All is done as you said, and the peace of Christ floods my soul—Malzoff."

Princess Nancy's ex-husband died a few months later, and she was profoundly thankful she had taken her friend's counsel. She would recount this story to her father back at the palace in St. Petersburg.

So was the effect of The Salvation Army, even in those early years, felt as far away as Russia. For you see, Princess Nancy Malzoff—the daughter of the Russian czar—a noble aristocrat who finally realized her sinful condition—the wronged wife who could finally find peace only in her own humility—

Is known to the world as "Anastasia."

You've read books, seen plays and watched movies about her life; but now you know more about Princess Anastasia, because now you know this answer to prayer.

## CHAPTER 26
### Singer, Composer, Pioneer Missionary

Mark Sanders is best known by present-day Salvationists for his first contribution to our songbook, "I Have Read of Men of Faith." Its rousing chorus places the essence of our organization's fervor in those early years: I'll gird on the armor and rush to the field; Determined to conquer, and never to yield!

Even the tune "Battle Cry of Freedom" was very popular in those post-Civil War years. The American tune, coupled with Sanders's zealous declaration of faith, has made this 1886 song a staple in every Song Book of The Salvation Army published since.

What a man of faith he must have been! What foresight he had!

For those of us who know little of him, we take this opportunity to explore Mark's world. Mark was assistant to Lt. Colonel Richard Slater (affectionately known as the father of Salvation Army music) and never very far from contact with no less than the Founder himself.

But that which made Mark such a unique member of our beloved Army is a fascinating gem in our Army's history.

Mark was born in poverty on April 28, 1862. As he grew, the frustration of adolescence set in early. At age 11, he was nearly expelled from the school where he was boarding at the time. Rebelling against what he felt was "legalized imprisonment," he devised a plan of escape.

Fortunately, the plan was halted before it really began, and Mark caught a vision of freedom wrought by good education. He applied himself to his studies and eventually became a teacher.

His greatest love, though, was music. He made astonishing progress as a pianist and developed skills on various other instruments. Crowds delighted to watch and listen, as he played the piano and concertina together—holding one end of the concertina with his foot!

His schooling ended in 1881, and later that year he joined The Salvation Army. After attending a 6 am meeting, he was converted.

He would now use his education and skills in the service of God.

Before long, Mark was quite in demand among corps throughout Britain. He even sang in meetings, some of which featured General William Booth as the speaker. By 1887, he went to America and assisted in the pioneering work of the Army in the West Indies.

Both at home and abroad, his music and original way of presenting the message gained him large and appreciative audiences. He married in 1897, and thereafter, the couple toured wherever the Army sent them for evangelistic purposes.

The latter part of his life was spent in Salt Lake City, Utah, where he remained a faithful soldier in one of the corps there. He served as corps pianist until his promotion to Glory on August 21, 1953.

Mark's contribution to Salvation Army music is inestimable. Many of his early compositions were published in The Musical Salvationist and Favorite Songs Supplement. A few appeared in subsequent printings of our songbook, and today, only his best compositions remain familiar.

But what an aggressive soul-winner he was! And how he used his talents of singing, playing and music composition to win large numbers of souls into the Kingdom! And what a source of encouragement it is to all who live with a handicap, and a blessing to those who do not, to learn that Mark Sanders—known in the early years of our Army's history as "Blind Mark"—did all of that in his world of total darkness.

That's right. Since he was just three days old, Mark Sanders was blind—and yet he saw by faith more than many sighted people see their whole lives.

He read of "men of faith." He put on his whole armor and "rushed to the field." He was "determined to conquer, and never to yield."

Now you know how Blind Mark fought for Jehovah. He stands as an example of faithful obedience to our Lord.

## CHAPTER 27
### The Founder's Mentor

Ask any Salvationist what we usually think of our Founder, William Booth, and you'll hear the following descriptions: almost saint-like, outspoken, extremely hard to please and tenacious, especially when it came to soul-winning. Nothing else mattered to him.

So, it's hard to think of such a person as having ever been young, inexperienced and very impressionable. Is it even possible that such a revered Salvation Army icon as General William Booth was at one time, early in life, in need of a mentor? Alas, Booth was human; God providentially provided for young William a spiritual father figure named James Caughey.

In the mid-19th Century, Caughey was a well-known revivalist. One of several European crusades took Caughey to Nottingham, England, in 1846, where William Booth heard him preach for the first time. Later, in 1857, William and Catherine met Caughey in Sheffield. So influenced were the young couple by this bold preacher that they had their second son, Ballington, baptized by him. And so it was, long before Booth had an Army over which to be General, the Founder was a Caughey disciple.

What a pleasant surprise, then, in December 1886, for Booth to pay a visit to his mentor's home in Albany, New York. The General was in Albany as part of his first tour of America. Booth's preaching engagements were quite the media sensation, and Caughey planned to attend at least one of Booth's meetings in Albany. Failing health prevented him, so Caughey sent an invitation for tea to his protégé.

Booth happily accepted, despite Booth's hectic schedule.

From the apartment door, Caughey led the General into his room. He turned the towering Booth round to the light, saying with a voice trembling with emotion, "Let me have a look at you!"

There was a long pause, after which Caughey's eyes filled with tears. Caughey finally spoke: "Yes. The same dear face. The same look. Blessed be God for this meeting!"

The two men of God sat down facing each other and shared God's wonderful dealings with them. In a little while, the General rose to go.

"Are you leaving?" Caughey asked.

"I must," the General replied. "We have a public meeting waiting for us."

"Too short; too short," the grand old warrior said.

Caughey walked the General to the door, looked up at his protégé and ordered: "Take off your hat! I am an older man than you, you know!"

And the General, reverently obeying, removed his hat and received the old preacher's blessing.

I don't suppose the Founder took too many orders in his later years as international leader of a worldwide ministry. But we can understand this exception, because now you know.

## CHAPTER 28
### The General's Crucifix

Being one of the world's leading Protestant organizations, The Salvation Army rightfully identifies with very few icons. Our Catholic brethren, on the other hand, have several special icons that are a part of their faith. Probably the most universally-recognized of these is the crucifix.

For that reason, you might be surprised to learn that there was one General in our history who proudly hung a crucifix in a prominent place above his desk for most of his career.

How General Clarence Wiseman came to cherish that religious item and its subsequent significance—well, that's another otherwise unknown chapter of our Army's history.

Majors Clarence and Janet Wiseman served in several corps throughout their Canadian homeland. Most corps had little money; each had their challenges; all proved to be rewarding, as God's hand could be plainly seen in each appointment.

Their careers gave them countless friends and associates through the years, and particularly one appointment in Newfoundland was no exception. St. John's Temple Corps provided a treasure trove of victories and blessings.

Then, at the beginning of 1954, the Wisemans received orders to report to territorial headquarters in Toronto. The Major was to become field secretary for the Canada and Bermuda Territory.

This new assignment meant a different direction in administrative appointments for the Wisemans, which culminated at International Headquarters in London as Clarence became the Army's 10th General.

As they prepared to leave St. John's, those last few weeks were hectic, to say the least. Besides the usual packing, farewell meetings and final reports, the Wisemans faced the trauma of leaving their twin children, Doreen and Donald. Both were now grown and had decided to stay.

The night before their departure, there was a heavy snowstorm. The major was out, and Mrs. Wiseman heard the doorbell ringing. "Who could possibly be calling in this weather?" she wondered aloud.

When she opened the door, an elderly man stood bundled and shivering in the snow. He announced that his name was Peter O'Mara, a fellow Rotary member of Major Wiseman's. Mr. O'Mara had come to say goodbye and was disappointed that Major Wiseman was not at home.

"Tell him I've been inspired time and time again by his speeches at the Rotary Club," Mr. O'Mara said, "and I want to give to him one of my most precious possessions."

With that, he pulled out a small crucifix and handed it to Mrs. Wiseman to deliver to her husband.

"It's my personal crucifix," O'Mara explained. "Please tell him that it will be a perpetual bond between us!"

Pulling up his coat collar, O'Mara disappeared into the howling blizzard.

General Clarence Wiseman would later write in his autobiography, A Burning In My Bones: "Since then we have lived in many parts of the world. In every place, that crucifix has occupied a place of honor over my desk, constantly reminding me not only of a faithful friend, but also of the Lord whom we both love—he in his way, and I in mine."

Both Peter O'Mara and General Clarence Wiseman are with the Lord now. Theirs was a special bond between two Christian believers—a covenant sealed on a snowy night more than 70 years ago. They shared a love for the Savior who made that covenant possible.

Now you know why the one-time international leader of the world's largest evangelical and charitable organization proudly displayed a simple crucifix hanging above his desk at 101 Queen Victoria Street in London.

For two men, who would only meet again in Heaven, this Catholic icon held even more meaning than usual.

So it's not hard to understand why General Wiseman regarded this gift with such esteem; and now you know this gem of the Army's history.

## CHAPTER 29
### The General's Resignation Letter

If Jesus was tempted by the devil—overcoming each of those three "easy ways out" from what lay before Him—why should we, as His followers, expect less? This truth was faced by Lieutenants Clarence & Janet Wiseman during their first appointments as Salvation Army officers—an ironic turn of events that very nearly wrecked their promising careers.

Mired in the Great Depression of the 1930s, Lieutenants Clarence & Janet were appointed to be corps officers in London, Ontario. The corps they found there was severely struggling both in numbers and in finances.

Tackling both battles seemed formidable, although membership steadily grew over time, thanks to an aggressive door-to-door visitation campaign the young couple began. In his autobiography, A Burning In My Bones, General Wiseman recalled that they were "armed with a Bible in one hand and a welfare order book in the other."

There were few paved roads in that area of London, so the Wisemans further equipped themselves with long rubber boots to negotiate the muddy streets. As the Wisemans devoted three to four days each week on their crusade, the number of people won into the corps slowly and impressively grew.

Addressing the second problem—corps finances—proved much harder. The people won to the Army had precious little to tithe in support to keep the corps ministry afloat. With no money to speak of for operation, the Wisemans suffered greatly with their own finances—unable to draw their allowance. This is where the devil presented a nearly irresistible offer—a chance to take a much easier way toward ministry.

"Satan is a master-tactician," General Wiseman later wrote, "and the particular moment he chooses to attack us, we are already tired and vulnerable."

The temptation came in a most timely fashion from Lieutenant Clarence's brother, who had become a minister in a large city church. The offer was a paid tuition to seminary in the U.S. All expenses were guaranteed, and following graduation, a pastorate in some established church was promised.

"Was this our way out? Was the Lord convincing us in a new direction?" the couple wondered for many agonizing hours.

"Anxiety overcame faith," Wiseman admitted. "It was one evening when I wrote the letter of resignation, which I filled with self-justifying phrases."

He placed the sealed envelope to be mailed the following morning in a dining room cupboard and turned in for the night. The next morning, devotions followed breakfast, as was their daily custom.

"Janet read the Bible, we knelt and I started to pray but very soon broke down. When I looked across at her, she was weeping."

They tore up the letter.

If you are at a point where "anxiety overcomes faith," remember the fateful letter that nearly changed the course of Salvation Army history. And remember this: even "would-be" generals are sometimes tempted!

## CHAPTER 30
### The Soul Winner

Known much more by his first name than by his full rank and name throughout his career around the world, his name is perhaps most recognizable to us as "Andy Miller" who played a sheriff on television in a small North Carolina town.

Even after his promotion to Glory in 2011, Commissioner Andrew S. Miller remains as loved and respected as any Salvation Army officer can be. In office, he rose as high as our USA National Commander, and yet, he always made others feel just as important in what they could contribute to the Army's mission and ministry.

I know a lot of "Andy Miller stories"—but this one in particular sums up the kind of man Commissioner Miller was—a soul winner.

What happened in this story may cause us to readily share the Good News of Jesus Christ in unexpected times.

Many years ago, the Millers were corps officers in Akron, Ohio. In those days, the old Akron Corps was located at 31 North Main Street in downtown. The Millers were giving exceptional pastoral care and guidance at the corps, and souls were being won into the Kingdom.

On a snowy night, something unexpected happened.

The assistant corps sergeant major accompanied Captain Miller as they made their way up a long staircase leading to the second floor where the administrative offices were located. When the captain opened his office door, they were both surprised by a couple of young burglars. The thieves bolted past the two men, down the stairs and out the front door.

And one of them had Captain Miller's briefcase!

Well, there wasn't anything in the briefcase of real value. I suppose it was the principle of it all that instinctively made the Captain follow out the door and down an alley at breakneck speed, close behind the culprits.

It wasn't until after the incident that they considered the danger involved, as the criminals might have been armed. "It was more instinct and reaction, than any courageous thought!" Commissioner Miller later admitted when he told the story.

And yes, Miller caught up with them. The offenders were a couple of kids—not much more than teens. They had broken into the corps office at the same door through which they tried to escape.

Surely, Miller's next move would be to call the police.

Do you remember that "instinctively," Miller and the assistant sergeant-major chased them, despite the danger? Well, just as instinctively, something within Captain Miller changed gears: Despite every right Miller had to call the cops and have the two bandits arrested, the Captain did something different, given the situation.

He witnessed to them!

Right there in the alley, surrounded by the cold darkness with only the light of a nearby streetlamp, Miller led the two boys to the Savior!

All of a sudden, the burglary to his office was incidental. The risk of life and limb during the chase became an afterthought. Even the retrieval of the briefcase was of no consequence. Nothing mattered more to Andy and to those two young men than to turn this awful negative into a glorious positive. And what a positive it was!

For those two boys, that night marked the end of their lives of crime and the beginning of their new lives in Christ Jesus! They even became involved in the corps program.

Down through the years, countless others have been won into the Kingdom through the loving ministry of Commissioners Andrew & Joan Miller—though admittedly none quite so exciting as the night Andy chased down two sinners and snatched them from the gates of Hell.

We can all understand that of all the "trophies of grace" won into the Kingdom by the Millers, the Commissioner fondly remembered these two with thankfulness for the rest of his life.

So, now you know that otherwise lost incident in Miller's extraordinary ministry.

## CHAPTER 31
### The Telegram

Our Army was still in its infancy. The growing pains that would come in the earliest years of our movement would only make us what we are today.

The Army had much opposition in those early days. More hurtful than the sticks and stones hurled at our comrades during outdoor meetings were the burning words printed on the pages of England's newspapers. Booth and his ragtag following had been hounded by the press—accused of everything from public deception to embezzlement.

So, when the name of our organization was changed from "The Christian Mission" to "The Salvation Army" in 1878 and Booth began being called "The General"—well, the press had a field day.

Thank God, then, that one simple telegram would change the public's opinion. It also gave credence to the way we now view our international leader.

When Booth founded the East London Christian Mission in 1865, it did not remotely appear like fertile ground for an Army.

Recalling those first years, Booth would later say: "God in His providence has led us, unwittingly so to speak, to make an army. We called it an army, and seeing that it was an army organized for the deliverance of mankind from sin and the devil, we called it an army of deliverance, an army of salvation—The Salvation Army."

Any army designed to rout the forces of evil needs a general to lead it. When we were simply The Christian Mission, Booth was acknowledged simply as "general superintendent."

Not even Booth himself was at first entirely comfortable with the title of General. His son, Bramwell, said of his father, "He was still in thought and mind a Methodist. He, of all people, had no ambition to be a pope."

The British newspapers cruelly persisted in printing the word "General" in quotation marks. This, Bramwell admitted much later, bothered William Booth most of all.

But then the telegram came.

Booth's new Army had convened at the world-famous Crystal Palace in London. Booth was there, of course, and was commanding the rapidly-expanding forces God had placed at the Army's disposal.

It was at that moment he was handed the telegram.

The message conveyed congratulations to The Salvation Army for tremendous strides made in just a few scant years. It was signed by Queen Victoria. And it was addressed to General William Booth—no quotation marks!

Booth was beside himself with elation. He waved the telegram before his troops and shouted, "Now they can keep their insulting quotation marks! I am a General—the Queen says so!"

The crowd roared their agreement.

This was the break Booth and the Army needed. The Queen gave her approval. Public ridicule gave way to respect, and even the press began to see that Booth's Army was here to stay.

The monarch of the world's greatest empire had legitimized a title that would thereafter be beyond dispute. With one stroke of the pen, Her Highness confirmed both a General and an Army.

There's really no way of knowing whether Queen Victoria realized the degree of positive affirmation bestowed by her royal message. At the very least, it was a message of gratitude for all the good this army of salvation was doing among the poorest of her empire. At best, it could be the Queen's subtle rebuke of newspapers generating one negative report after another.

Especially to those of us who dearly love our Army, we probably prefer to think an otherwise courtesy-like countless other congratulatory notes sent from the Queen's signature by an unknown personal secretary—was the most important.

At least it is for us, because now you know about this milestone in the Army's history.

## CHAPTER 32
### The World's Favorite Hymn

George Bennard was the son of a coal miner. His family lived in poverty and moved from town to town across the Midwest—wherever Dad could find work. George was born in Youngstown, Ohio, but after several stops, the family found themselves in Lucas, Iowa. It was there that George's father succumbed to the brutality of black lung disease, and 16-year-old George had no choice but to work in the coal mines to support his widowed mother and four sisters.

George also found himself at The Salvation Army Corps there in Lucas, and it was at the Mercy Seat that George's life took a radical change of direction. George was gloriously saved, called to Salvation Army officership and went on to compose more than 300 Gospel songs before his death in 1958.

However, one song in particular went on to embed itself in the songbooks of nearly all Protestant denominations worldwide. It is a song many know today—an eternal tribute to one of the Army's own.

That song and the heartfelt needs George met in his life are well worth our consideration on our Christian walk.

George immersed himself in Gospel ministries as an outlet to the enormous responsibilities left to him by his father's death. The War Cry would later say of him: "He worked with Salvationists and for some time, constantly seeing the struggles of humanity and knowing its need for something to cling to—something to help the people over the dark places in the road they daily faced."

George eventually married, left mining and served as corps officer in several appointments. He later became an international traveling evangelist. He was also connected with the Chicago Evangelistic Institute, with a particular interest in city mission work and evangelism.

One of his favorite Scripture verses is found in 1 Peter 2:24—He personally carried our sins in His body on the cross so that we can be dead to sin and live for what is right. By His wounds you are healed.

Little wonder then, that this verse—coupled with an unceasing image of people desperately groping for something of eternal worth to cling to—would drive George to pen what has been called "The World's Favorite Hymn."

He would later recall, "I composed the melody first. The words that I first wrote were imperfect. The words of the finished hymn were put into my heart in answer to my own need. Shortly after it was introduced at special meetings in Pokagon, Michigan, it became extremely popular throughout the country."

He sent the finished manuscript copy to Charles Gabriel, one of the leading Gospel composers of that era. Gabriel's prophesy, "You will certainly hear from this song," proved true, as it became one of the most widely-published songs in both the sacred and secular spheres.

At age 85, on October 9, 1958, George Bennard exchanged his "cross for a crown." And if you are ever a few miles north of Reed City, Michigan, you will see a 12-foot cross with the words, "The Old Rugged Cross—Home of George Bennard, composer of this beloved hymn."

Although we do not worship the cross, but rather the Christ on the cross, we cannot ponder the truths of Christ's atonement without a keen awareness of the centrality of the cross in God's redemption plan.

George Bennard knew this all too well when he first began clinging to the old rugged cross as he knelt at a Salvation Army altar. That image went with him through his career as an officer and was passed on to the world's denominations—a lasting legacy of one of the Army's sons.

The next time you sing the world's favorite hymn and your eyes glisten a bit as you are transported to "a hill far away," you perhaps will cherish that hymn all the more—not only because it portrays an "emblem of suffering and shame," but because it was crafted by one from our ranks, and a fellow trophy-exchanger.

## CHAPTER 33
### Thrice Blessed!

Frank Tower's introduction to The Salvation Army was brief—but it was an incident he remembered for the rest of his life.

As a younger man, he found a steady line of work by signing aboard steamers that crisscrossed the Atlantic. Since he was a tough fellow with a strong back and not afraid of hard work, he became a "stoker"—shoveling coal into the ocean liner's insatiable boilers.

And so, it was that on one of the many ships on which he worked through the course of his life, Frank Tower achieved a most unusual reason for celebrity and forever forged a link with The Salvation Army's history. What we are about to learn about this thrice-blessed man qualifies his as an ironic hero of faith.

It was May 1914, and Frank arrived at the dock where the RMS Empress of Ireland was moored. He had made the trip across the ocean many times before and aboard more ships than he cared to count. But this voyage was ill-fated. During the wee hours of May 29, the Empress of Ireland would go to the bottom of the St. Lawrence River—taking with her well over a thousand souls.

There were 200 Salvationists aboard who were taking passage to England and the International Congress held in London. But 167 Salvationists were promoted to Glory in this disaster—among them the Territorial Commander for Canada & Bermuda (Commissioner David M. Rees), other high-ranking officers and most of the renowned Canadian Staff Band.

In fact, the Staff Band gave an impromptu concert on the deck of the ship before they set sail. One can only imagine the excitement filling the air as passengers and crew members boarded while hearing the lilting melodies played by some of the best musicians Canada offered.

It is almost certain that Frank Tower heard this music, either as he arrived at the dock, or even as he went about his many duties before the voyage could begin that evening. It is also certain that with so many Salvationists about, Frank had ample opportunities to speak with some of them before his shift in the engine room began later that evening.

Until this point, Frank Tower's association with his new friends was a happy one, as he shared in the excitement and adventure of the trip that lay ahead. But joy would turn into sorrow just hours later, as Frank helped pull several of the dozens of surviving Salvationists into lifeboats.

Frank was in the engine room when calamity struck. Fog had enveloped most of the river. The Empress and SS Storstad suddenly were engaged on a collision course. The Storstad rammed broadside into the Empress, leaving a huge gash below the water line. With water surging in, Frank and his workmates dropped their shovels and made for the nearest vertical ladder.

As he ran for his life, Frank must have been thinking, Oh no—not again! For he also survived, in similar fashion, the same nightmare only two years earlier, when he worked aboard the RMS Titanic.

In the event of emergency, Frank's crew was instructed to proceed to Lifeboat #5, which they did. But due to the extreme tilt of the ship, the lifeboat swung out, slipped off its davits and dropped into the water. Fortunately, it fell upright—but now it was drifting away.

Frank dove into the water, secured the lifeboat and spent the next few hours plucking Salvationists and other survivors out of the cold water.

Sure, Frank Tower was a hero. But he achieved a celebrity he'd rather not have endured—having been "twice blessed" in surviving two maritime disasters.

The Army thereafter held Frank Tower in high esteem, not just for his heroism but for his friendliness before and after the disaster. A bond was forged between the Army and Frank, which lasted until his death a few decades later.

No doubt Frank Tower was blessed—but not just "twice blessed." For you see, his next assignment was aboard yet another ill-fated vessel, the RMS Lusitania, which was sunk by German U-boats at the outset of World War One! Yes, he survived that one in nearly the identical way.

So, we leave him "thrice blessed"—and we are blessed as well, because now you know the rest of the Army's story.

## CHAPTER 34
### Titanic Prophesy

Commander Evangeline Booth waited at the harbor of New York City to comfort survivors of the greatest maritime disaster in history.

On the other side of the Atlantic, General William Booth was mourning the loss of one of the Army's dearest allies.

W.T. Stead boarded the RMS Titanic at 11:30 on the morning of April 11, 1912. He and a group of other first-class passengers had been ferried to the huge ship by a special tender bedecked with blue and gold tassels. By 1:30 p.m., 1,321 passengers and 908 crewmen were aboard.

Three whistle blasts sounded, and the great leviathan steamed out for the open seas.

The events of the tragic last hours of Titanic are now well-documented. Countless articles, books and movies remind us that life is fragile, even aboard an "unsinkable" ship.

What you may not know, however, is that survivors said Stead was among the many gallant men who helped others onto lifeboats, even as the ship was in its final throes. You also may not know another interesting fact that reveals another connection Stead had with a member of the White Star Line of ocean-crossing vessels.

W.T. Stead had a brilliant career as England's leading journalist. He worked for and eventually became editor of the Pall Mall Gazette in the 1880s. By the 1890s, he had helped to start the Review of Reviews—building it into one of England's leading periodicals. Stead was also a great friend of The Salvation Army. By 1885, the Army was embroiled with public officials over the issue of child slavery. This caught Stead's attention, and the Army thus found a mighty ally in the press. Stead even called himself "the Honorary Trumpeter of The Salvation Army."

Using his Pall Mall Gazette to publish a sensational series of articles titled The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon, Stead made the British public realize that child prostitution was a terrifying and ongoing blight on society. Within three weeks, a petition bearing 343,000 signatures demanded the revision of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill. Twelve representative Salvationists laid the petition on the floor of the House of Commons, and within a fortnight, Parliament raised the age of consent to 16.

As a result, the Army found itself much more credible with the public—and a terrible social evil was eliminated.

Stead wrote the first biographies of both William and Catherine Booth, and was partly responsible for the Army's first expansion into Russia. He even helped William Booth with the mammoth task of forming In Darkest England and the Way Out.

About that same period, Stead was working on a piece of fiction about a nautical tragedy. Some years later, he published "From the Old World to the New" in the Christmas edition of the Review of Reviews.

The major facts in Stead's story proved to be prophetic. The ship in question was called the Majestic and was part of the White Star Line's fleet. He even described the ocean liner as "a monstrous floating Babylon."

The plot climaxed with Majestic hitting an iceberg and taking most on board to the bottom of the Atlantic. The enormous loss of life was due primarily to a shortage of lifeboats.

More eerie is the fact that Stead had a passing ship eventually coming onto the scene to collect what survivors it could. He named that ship's skipper "Captain E.J. Smith," which was by coincidence the same name as the Titanic's captain!

We can only speculate as to what W.T. Stead's last thoughts were on that awful night in April 1912. He was steaming to America at the invitation of President William Howard Taft to speak at the World Peace Conference at Carnegie Hall. Before setting sail from England, his parting words to Bramwell Booth were: "Ah! It is in God I trust—only the living God can hold up a living soul!"

Perhaps those comforting words were on his mind as he slipped into the icy deep. And perhaps he remembered his own prophesy of another great ship's demise in a story he himself had penned in 1892—20 years before Titanic's maiden voyage to infamy.

## CHAPTER 35
### Transcending Prison Walls

Brigadier Josef Korbel spent ten dark years in a communist prison. His only crime was to preach the Gospel as a Salvation Army officer. This Brigadier's testimony of God's constant providence is chronicled in his two books, In My Enemy's Camp and When the Gates Are Opened.

The Salvation Army had been dissolved in Czechoslovakia in the years that followed World War Two. Brigadier Korbel's heart-gripping story proves that God is not bound by prison walls. Korbel testifies of God's wondrous and miraculous powers, which he witnessed in spite of the forced labor, beatings, tortures and squalid conditions thrust upon him.

Worst of all was the complete absence of communication with his beloved wife, Erna, and their three children. During his ten-year imprisonment, he knew none of his family's condition, welfare, or even their whereabouts. That is, except for one day, when God threw a blast of light into the dark, dank cell with the arrival of a very special cellmate. The news this cellmate brought to Korbel is our remarkable revelation to discover, some 70 years later.

Korbel was already a learned man in Prague, where he studied art and became a textile designer. Then The Salvation Army opened the work in that city in 1920. His first contact with Salvationists came when he saw them preaching and singing in the streets. His family had been indifferent to religion, but the Army's unique and forthright message gripped his heart. He accepted Christ as his Savior, and a year later, he entered the Training College to prepare for Salvation Army officership.

He and Erna married in 1933 and served in various corps appointments throughout Czechoslovakia.

Then came the arrest and imprisonment.

The treatment he received at the hands of the cruel guards was nothing compared to the agony of not communicating with his family. Several years into the imprisonment, God sent a revelation to Korbel in the form of this new cellmate. In the middle of the night, the rattling of keys startled Korbel from his sleep, and four guards pushed a man into the small cell with him.

"You are responsible for him that he doesn't hang himself!" the guards yelled at Korbel, as they locked the cell and left.

Brigadier Korbel describes the man, whose name was Krejci, as a nice-looking, well-dressed young man. He was wearing an expensive fur coat, jacket and white shirt. But all his clothing was badly stained with blood flowing from his swollen face. The man was so beaten, he could not speak. The Brigadier tenderly helped him into the cell's only bed, laid him down and used a piece of rag for a towel to sponge his face with water. Krejci was breathing quickly and moaning occasionally.

As dawn lit the cell, the extent of his injuries could be seen. His nose and eyes were black. He suffered in silence, not speaking until well that evening when Korbel began to gain his confidence.

Krejci began to tell his story of his anti-communist activity, which was followed by his arrest at the border, as he was attempting to cross illegally.

Korbel answered that his only crime was preaching the Word of God as a Salvation Army officer in Brno.

"In Brno? In The Salvation Army?" Krejci exclaimed. "I am from Brno, and I know a nurse there who almost daily attended my sick mother. This nurse also used to be in The Salvation Army before the organization was liquidated. She was such a lovely and tender woman, and my mother just loved her!"

Korbel's interest was piqued; he knew all the members of the former Brno Corps but had no idea that a nurse was among them.

"Do you remember her name?"

"Oh yes, I do. Her name was Mrs. Korbel," Krejci answered excitedly.

The Brigadier jumped up. "Korbel? Erna Korbel? That is my wife!"

Krejci listened intently to all the news of his wife and family. They were safe and not in prison, as he had feared.

In the days that followed, Korbel led Krejci to the Lord Jesus. Meanwhile, Mrs. Korbel was still nursing the elderly lady and led her to Christ as well. It was not until years later, after Krejci was released and reunited with his mother, and the Brigadier had been freed, that the Korbels received a postcard thanking them for their simultaneous ministry.

"We realized how wonderfully God had answered prayer and used us in the same cause without our being aware of it!" Brigadier Korbel would later write.

Now you know how in Brigadier Korbel's remarkable life, the will of God transcended even prison walls!

## CHAPTER 36
### A Typical Army Wedding

In the early days of the Salvation Army in Australia, the one thing you could always expect was the unexpected—particularly at any indoor or outdoor public meeting.

The more controversial and attention-getting, the better.

Sometimes shocking? Sure.

Curious onlookers came to the meetings in droves, and many got saved. Any occasion was fair game for a worship service that featured the unusual. These meetings were held at baby dedications, music recitals, weddings and funerals. Any chance to give praise to God and a peppering of the Gospel to the unconverted was more than possible—it was inevitable.

One wedding in particular bears this out. Never mind that the wedding took place on Christmas Day 1883—that only made the nuptials all the more befitting by Salvation Army standards.

The only reason why we know about this wedding nearly 150 years later is thanks to Captain Peter Lovelock's diary and subsequent report published in The War Cry (Australia). It seems the captain was faithful and detailed in all his daily entries. And the busyness of Christmas work notwithstanding, Lovelock would burn the midnight oil at his Corps in downtown Sydney, right down to the nth degree.

The wedding was merely another event in an already crowded week of Corps activities—even if it was Christmas. That year, Christmas fell on a Monday. That evening's entry sounded like any other night of the year when the Salvos (Australians' affectionate term for Salvationists) did battle against sin and evil in Sydney's dark streets.

Lovelock wrote on December 24, "Monday night still found us on the warpath, attacking sin, drink, and all sorts of evil. Hall crowded to the doors. Testimonies to God's saving grace were given by converted drunkards and respectable sinners."

The only one missing at the Monday night Christmas Eve meeting was old St. Nick himself.

But the best, Lovelock insisted, was to come on Christmas Day.

That bright Christmas day afternoon found a Protestant hall as the wedding locale. The ceremony started well for Salvationists, as a Salvation meeting broke out. Spontaneous testimonies were given and prayers of thanksgiving lifted toward Heaven.

And then there was the marriage ceremony itself, conducted by a Major Sutherland, and the knot was tied off perfectly.

During the reception that followed, the groom's story was told. Wedding guests listened very attentively as the old bridegroom told his courtship stories—many met with laughter, applause and shouts of "Amen!" and "Praise the Lord!"

We even know what happened on the honeymoon.

Lovelock's diary entry for Wednesday (Boxing Day) notes that the bride and groom were again with their comrades—this time in a parade of witness down a Sydney main street leading to the railway station. A brass band marched out in front followed by uniformed lads and lassies. Tin whistles, fifes, tambourines, a banjo and even a fiddle all made joyful noise to the Lord and for anyone else captivated by the sight.

The captain recorded in his diary that many of that area for the first time had spent a sober Christmas because of their complete conversion.

Such an unusual wedding deserves an unusual place in Army history. As such, Captain Peter Lovelock's diary entries were read by comrades across Australasia, when it was reported the following week in The War Cry.

Up until now, we hadn't learned the identity of the bride and groom.

Perhaps it was modesty that prevented Lovelock to say too much about her, even though, technically, this was supposed to be her day. One's wedding day is supposed to be what every little girl dreams of having.

But Lizzie was happy on that magical Christmas Day when she became Mrs. Captain Peter Lovelock.

That's right. Peter could give such an accurate account for War Cry readers, because the Salvation meeting he enjoyed so much—was his own.

Now, we can say we were there with the happy couple as well, because now you know a story of martial bliss.
