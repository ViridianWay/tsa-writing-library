# Mothers' Meetings

_From "How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel" by William Booth_

---

The following sketch of the Whitechapel meeting, written by a lady who devotes the whole of her time to the Mission, will not only be read with interest, but will describe better than anything we can say the character of our Mothers' meetings: —

> Our mothers' meeting is composed chiefly of very poor women. The advantage of being able to get clothing by the payment of small weekly sums, is a benefit much appreciated by them; though often we are pained to hear the words, I cannot say anything today, my husband is out of work, and we don't know how to get bread."
> 
> The mothers' meeting is to many the one bright spot in their otherwise monotonous and dreary lot. They linger, unwilling to leave. "It is so nice to be here," one will say. And another, "The fire is so cheerful and warm." Poor things, perhaps, no fire awaits them at their comfortless little rooms called home, and no food either.
> 
> There is among the women, a very pleasing spirit of union and sympathy, one with another. They are always ready to pray with and comfort any of their number who may be in trouble; and will volunteer to go and look after those who may be absent.
> 
> To some, the meeting is especially dear as the place where Jesus spoke peace to their souls.
> 
> Two young mothers, each bringing an infant, came one afternoon, through the invitation of a friend. We gave them a kindly welcome, and drew out a little of their history. The husband of the younger has been paralysed for two years, quite unable to help himself; how they live is a mystery. The other was a sister-in-law, living in the same house, struggling with extreme poverty. Warm Christian sympathy was something new to them, and soon, under the influence of the constraining love of Jesus, they yielded their hearts to Him. Whoever is absent, we are always sure to meet our two friends; the look of care, almost hopelessness, has given place to an expression of hope and peace.

Often when we are singing some cheering hymn about the "Beautiful land on high," or of the "Saviour dear to many a heart," the poor women seem to forgot their poverty and cares, and their faces light up with joy.

Not very long since, a poor woman entered our meeting anxious about her soul, and before she went away was made a new creature in Christ Jesus; joy took the place of sorrow; and she tells us now she is so happy, that often she lies awake in the night singing and praying.

The same afternoon the Lord saved another of our number. The first mentioned is suffering the deepest poverty, with scarcely clothes to cover her, neither bedding nor firing; her husband had been ill for fourteen weeks; all their home had to go, and they were on the brink of starvation. The man is still unable to get work.

"Oh, how *beautiful* that blanket is you lent me, I had it on my bed last night!" said one of our mothers the other afternoon; and the poor woman fairly laughed at the remembrance of the comfort she had for the winter. Her history is a peculiarly distressing one. Her husband, after a long course of brutal treatment, left her with two children, allowing her only the shilling a week he is compelled. She has struggled on some years, holding fast her confidence in God, and now she is suffering with a fearfully bad leg, and though she can scarcely stand, is obliged to go out washing when she can get it to do, or starve. Each of our mothers has a history, some of touching interest, which we could give, would space allow.

## OUR MATERNAL SOCIETY

Has been in existence three years, and during that time has extended its helping hand to about two hundred poor women.

Beside a bag of suitable clothing for the mother and babe, each woman receives during the month 3s., generally in the form of nourishment.

Many are the cases of terrible distress which have come under our notice through this society. Often the poor infant is wrapped in an old shawl until the bag arrives, and then again has nothing when the things are returned.

> Will our friends enter with us a miserable room. On what is termed a bed lies a poor woman recently confined. We see that without prompt aid she will soon leave her children motherless. By her side nestles the new-born infant, seeking for the nourishment the sinking mother has no power to give. The husband, who has been out of work for months sits with a look of hopelessness, painful to witness. To complete the mournful picture, three little children are crying for bread. Want had done its work on two a short time previous, and the tender Shepherd has taken them to His own keeping, and left the others for His people to tend. Did we need any reward for our work of love in at once procuring nourishment, and comfortably clothing the poor mother and infant we should be amply repaid by the gratitude which chokes utterance. Would that this were a solitary case; but we could give many similar.

Not only has this Society rendered help to many a poor woman ready to perish for want of food to sustain the body; but it has led some to eat of the bread of life. One poor mother who, when just visited, was totally ignorant of the way of salvation, died a few weeks after, rejoicing in Jesus, and blessing the instrumentality that led her to the Saviour.

## BIBLE CLASSES.

Numbers of those brought to God in this movement have no Bible knowledge whatever beyond the fragments of truth picked up during the few services which led to their conversion. Therefore Bible Classes, always important, are doubly so in their case. At those stations where there are persons able to conduct such classes in an edifying manner, we have already formed them. At Whitechapel, Mr. Hamilton, a member of the committee, has a class of about one hundred members, mostly men; and we hope the time is not far distant when we shall have one or more at every station.

## BIBLE CARRIAGE.

From the commencement of this work we decided, if possible, to connect with it the dissemination of gospel literature; but, as yet, we have not succeeded according to our wishes. First we tried a book-stall by the roadside, a cheap mode of operation; but far more stock was spoiled by exposure to the weather than was disposed of. Then we tried, one after the other, three shops, prominently situated, as Bible and Tract depots; but the sales not paying expenses, these were relinquished. Then we had a Bible-carriage, built at a cost of £17; but the warehouse in which it was stored was burned down, and the carriage with it, for which we obtained no recompense. Nevertheless, we told the story to our friends, and they entrusted us with means to purchase another superior to the first; but this has not succeeded to our minds, not clearing working expenses in the summer, while in the winter the sales have been very small indeed. This failure doubtless results from the fact that before conversion the poor people of the East of London seldom or ever read a religious book, and after conversion the Bible and hymnbook constitute their library, all the little money they get being required for necessary food and raiment,

However, we shall try again; and we are now fitting up the carriage with Bibles, books, tracts, and pictures already in stock, and hope, by taking a wider circuit, to succeed better.

## TEMPERANCE SOCIETIES.

Signing the pledge has been often referred to in connection with the cases of reformation described in these pages. No one can be long engaged in such a work as this without being appalled at the havock caused by intoxicating drinks among the class of people with whom we labour, and whom we seek to save. More or less, this is the great snare of working men, and this is certainly the cause of most of the painful cases of backsliding over which we have to mourn. Around us are thousands who have already offered time, and means, and happiness, and all that is most valuable of earth, at the shrine of strong drink, and who, through it, are in danger of losing all that is most precious in eternity; and it seems to us that no one can go heart and soul into the work of saving them without themselves renouncing the cause of so much misery and crime, and also urging with all their might those most interested to do the same. Hence at almost every station we have a temperance meeting nearly every Saturday night. These meetings are conducted in a strictly religions manner. Only Christians are allowed to take public part in them; they are always opened by singing and prayer, and it is no uncommon thing for a temperance meeting to be concluded with an anxious meeting, at which souls seek and find Jesus. In this way thousands have been induced to sign the pledge, and many have in these meetings made our acquaintance who have come the next night to hear the Gospel, thus making the temperance pledge the stepping-stone to godliness and eternal life. Numerous illustrations of these remarks are scattered through this report, otherwise we would give some here; but should further proof be desired, we can supply it in abundance.

## BANDS OF HOPE.

In order to warn the young and preserve them from the vortex of intemperance, the eddying whirl of which is all around them everywhere, we try to instil into their minds the principles of total abstinence. Believing prevention to be better than cure, we try by every means to save them from falling into the drinking customs so prevalent and ruinous around them.

## THE RELIEF OF DESTITUTE SAINTS.

All who read these pages will observe that many of those brought to God through the instrumentality of this Mission, are at the time of their conversion in deep poverty; while others are ever and anon being brought into a similar condition. Perhaps the husband falls out of work, or is afflicted, or death enters the dwelling, and there is the expense of a funeral, or some other of the oft-recurring tribulations incident to poverty, for which they have had, since the commencement of the new life, neither time nor opportunity to make any provision. In such circumstances they look to us, and we feel it a sacred duty to help them as far as is possible to us. It is but little we can do; but by the help of a few loving friends that little has been done.

In some cases an extra loaf or two has been added to the starvation supply from the parish; or a small quantity of nourishing food has been given to the sick; or a trifle of money to help them to bury their dead. In other cases, a few shillings have been given to keep the brokers out, or to get them out when in; or a tool has been purchased to enable the bread-winner to take a job. Sometimes a poor man has been fixed up with a costermonger's barrow, or a few things have been supplied for an empty one; or a subscription list has been headed to enable a poor widow to buy a mangle. In other cases, a blanket has been lent to a shivering family, or a second hand overcoat, or a woolen shawl has been provided for some poor consumptive; and many other slight ameliorations of starvation and suffering have been supplied. What has been done in the past we desire to continue doing in the future. Surely there is no room for controversy as to the duty of the Lord's people with respect to the suffering members of His own household. How otherwise can we deal with such cases as the following, and of scores of similar ones appealing to us at the present moment: —

A. is a devoted Christian. She is unable to work. The parish allows her 1s. per week and a loaf. I have visited her for four years, and have often found her without food. She attends our meetings in the bitterest weather, and sometimes with only a thin garment on her shivering frame.

B. is a man once in respectable circumstances, but was taken ill with rheumatic fever ten months ago, and has not worked since. He has a delicate wife and child and during this time they have lived chiefly by disposing of their home, and have parted with almost everything they could either pledge or sell. Six shillings per week is all they have to live upon, half-a-crown of which they pay for rent. They are both, I believe, devoted Christians.

C injured his side in a fall from a building some years ago, and has been a cripple ever since. Wandering about the streets, he was attracted by the singing to an open-air meeting; and after listening for some time, followed our friends into the Hall, where he found the Saviour. He has attended the services ever since; and though very poor, he is happy in the Lord. Unable to do work of any kind on account of his lameness, he earns a trifle by selling papers, &c. in the street. This, with the little help we give him, is all he has to live upon; but we are afraid he has occasionally to walk the streets for want of threepence to pay for a bed.

D. was converted twenty years ago, under a sermon preached by Mr. Booth, and has been following on ever since. When we opened the Penny Gaff, she asked if she might join us. Very poor, she is very glad of a ticket for a little soup, although she has to go all the way to Whitechapel for it. She said the other day, she did not know how they should have got through last winter if it had not been for our help. Her husband, two sons, and her daughter's husband were all out of work at the same time and they all lived together with nothing to depend on but the tickets and a little washing.

E. — HELP IN THE LAST HOUR. — One man said, "The doctor has given me up and told me I cannot live more than a few days at most; he says there is no hope for me, but I have a hope, a blissful hope: die when I may, I can look death in the face and say, 'Oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory?' I am quite prepared at any time, and I think it will not be long now. I can take nothing but jellies and soups, and things that are moist; but," he said, "I do not find anything stop on my stomach like that beautiful soup. You are the best friend I have on earth, I can take nothing so well as that soup." The man is still alive and very happy, and believes he can live and die with *soup and Christ*.

F. — CAST DOWN, BUT NOT DESTROYED. One night I visited two of our people, a man and his wife. They were just going to break their fast, at half-past seven at night, with a little bread and butter. On a straw bed, in one corner, lay the only child they had, then and there in the arms of death. The man looked me in the face and said, "You see we are in a poor way, sir. We have only two chairs and a bit, and not much to eat; but we are happy in Jesus. We have a seat prepared for us in heaven." I said, "Praise God." Gave them some relief, and prayed with them. I shall not soon forget the heart-rending scene. The child has since gone to heaven. The parents have but little work, and but little to eat; but they are very happy. I often wish the friends who send us relief could witness some of the cases I have to visit. Heaven only knows how my heart bleeds because we cannot do more than we do.

G. — One Sunday evening, nearly three years ago, a wretchedly dissipated looking woman came into the Theatre, attracted by the singing in the streets. The word went home to her soul, and she sought earnestly for mercy; but went away sorrowing, thinking there could not be pardon for such a sinner. But a few days after, at one of our believers' meetings, she heard the Saviour say, "Go in peace, thy sins are forgiven thee." She had been for twenty years a fearful drunkard, once in a drunken fit jumping out of a window two stories high. Often she has struck her husband with a poker when he has been kneeling in prayer. After his death she sank to the lowest state of degradation, herding with the most abandoned. Since her conversion she has held on her way in the midst of persecution and poverty. She is now living in a small attic, for which she pays is 9d. per week. It is as clean as her employment will permit, which is mending old boots and shoes, receiving 2d. and 3d. for soling and heeling each pair. When she can get work she can earn 6d. per day; but very often work fails. Her bed is composed of some straw sewn up in an old petticoat, part of an old counterpane is all her covering; a stool and little table complete the furniture of this dear child of God. And yet she says *she never feels dull, Jesus is with her*; and when she has no work, as she cannot read, she sits and sings "them blessed hymns." One day she was visited just in time to save her from dying of starvation. She had laid on her miserable bed three days without food; but said she did not feel hungry, the Lord Jesus had stood by her, and fed her with the bread of life.

H. — Two dear women, mother and daughter both widows earn a miserable existence by making slop shirts. They lie at night on a bundle of straw, with only the scanty clothing they wear during the day to cover them. They are wonderfully cheerful and happy, taking any little gift as coming from the Lord. When a warm petticoat was given to the mother (who is 87), and the promise of a loan blanket as soon as the Lord sent the money to buy the, tears of gratitude ran down her aged cheeks, and she praised the Lord who was *so kind* to her.

The last case we select is one of deep interest, illustrating the power of divine grace to raise and elevate those lowest sunk in misery and sin. It is thus described by a lady working in the Mission:

## A CONVERTED NAVVY.

Some months ago we visited a poor navvy supposed to be dying. To the surprise of all, after months of extreme suffering, he recovered sufficiently to gain a livelihood. Finding him entirely destitute of necessaries, we relieved him. He disliked the idea of receiving money, and told us that he was sorry to take from the Mission; that God had pardoned his sins, and that was the reason why he loved the Mission. As soon as he recovered sufficiently to earn a few shillings, he brought us eighteenpence "to be given to some other poor creature as badly off as himself." He gave us the following account of himself.

> "There never was such another. Why you don't know how bad a man can be. The devil had like to have got me, but the Lord was better nor him. Did you ever hear I broke up my home three times? First time I went when my wife was not, and smashed all I could and threw them out of the window. I was had before the magistrate, and bound over for six months; and the first chance I had, I again went and did the same. Last time I thought I would finish it up. My wife had to run away. I'd made up my mind to murder her, and when drunk used to watch for her on Sunday nights coming out of the Ellingham Theatre, where the Mission was holding services; but the child would tell her 'Daddy's coming, Mammy,' and somehow she managed to escape me. One night I'd made my mind up. Eh! I do bless the Lord, He managed Satan. It was Him who drew me out of the Whitechapel Road into the old Theatre. One and another come and talked to me, and instead of collaring my wife, I went to the penitent form. I don't know how I came to do so. I was like spell-bound. I went home to my lodging. They thought me mad. My conscience would let me do nothing; the Lord got me so. After a while my wife returned home, and we have since a comfortable home.
> 
> "Ah! Miss, the Lord can do anything. He converted me when I'd neither shirt, shoes, nor stockings on; and now I've got all I want.
> 
> "You know about my illness. I'd such a beautiful dream then; it seemed as if angels came and set me down on the golden pavement. 'Tis just as if I could see it now. I'd like to go to tonight.
> 
> "After my conversion I looked back a little. Satan would like to have had me; but God kept me from drink and going into sin, and ever since that time I got clear again. I'm more determined than ever to serve the Lord. I'm very happy. Bless the Lord, I do love Him; I'm ready to go whenever He may call me."

His countenance, words, and actions all proved to us that this was indeed a brand plucked from the burning.

## BELIEVERS' MEETINGS.

Before closing this notice of the measures employed in this Mission, we feel we must mention the little private meetings into which we endeavor to group the persons who profess faith in Christ. In order that we may exercise the necessary oversight and watchful care, and render the personal counsel and sympathy so much needed by those rescued from such depths of sin, and still placed in circumstances of trial and temptation, we place a few under the guidance of the more experienced and trustworthy members. Their work is to meet them once every week; and, in case of absence, to visit them at their homes, inquire into the cause of their absence, and in every case, whether of indifference or sickness, offer counsel, reproof, or consolation as they may need.

## OUR CHRISTMAS DINNER FOR THE POOR.

At this festive season, our friends from far and near have generously enabled us to distribute 500 dinners, consisting of a piece of beef and a plum pudding, together with a portion of tea, sugar, and half a hundred weight of coal, among as many of the suffering poor families who throng the East of London. The last effort is thus described by the lady who had the supervision of it.

> We can assure those who are strangers to this kind of work, that our difficulty lay not in finding that number or families who would be without a Christmas dinner, but in choosing the most pressing cases of the many around us.
> 
> One morning as, much wearied in our labour, we were tempted to think but slightly of the privilege thus given, the thought presented itself, — in God's providence, we were permitted to be the channel through which more than 1,000 men, women, and children would, at least, be largely helped to spend a happy Christmas day. Immediately our minds wandered to the families. Children, merry for once in their lives, dancing round the table (where a table could be found), at any rate, round the unwonted feast. The father, who has lain sick and helpless for many a long week on yonder bed, cheered by the glad sound of laughter, thinks, perhaps, of the Giver of all good gifts, and, maybe for the first time in his life, is grateful to God. Who can tell but this gratitude may lead to repentance to obedience and a happy life? God grant it!
> 
> One more inmate of that room we must not forget. The poor, busy, careworn mother who, with a little infant and five other little ones, has toiled early and late. She has already learned to love the Saviour, and her only consolation in this trial of her husband's sickness has been the hope that, thus shut out from bad companions and the public house, her long and fervent prayer may be answered, that love for wife and children may be renewed, and that his soul may be saved. How, at the glad sight before her, as she glances from the happy children to her husband's unusually gentle smile, she sees already an answer to her prayer, and she gathers fresh strength from the fact that God has not forgotten her. Such is no fancy picture, reader. We could take you to the street, the room, the parents, the children. Can you wonder, then, that after such thoughts we went forward gladly and cheerfully to our labour of love?
> 
> We would that every one who has given of their abundance could have seen one dear woman. She had known better days; but, through varied trials, was reduced to absolute poverty. As she took the ticket for pudding, beef, tea, and sugar, she looked at us, grasped our hands, and was turning away with filled eyes. We said, "Have you a coal ticket?" "No," she replied, "that too? Oh, it is too much, too much!" and hastening to the nearest corner out of sight, sank down to thank God, who, she said, "knew all about her, and had sent this in her hour of extremity."
> 
> One more picture. A sister in Jesus, who had gladly shared in the distribution of tickets, told us the following story.
> 
> As she opened the door, the mother, a widow, surrounded by her children, had been talking over Christmas day. "What shall we do, mother? Why may we not have some meat at Christmas?" The poor woman harassed by these trying questions, was advising them to remain in bed all day, and try to forget. We will leave the reader to picture the glad surprise and pleasant change that our sister's entrance made, especially when the welcome news was announced that they were all to have a dinner on Christmas day.
> 
> Eight of our own dear women, "out of work," helped in the preparation of puddings. Prayer, singing, and praise occupied their tongues, while busy hands set to work, with right good will.
> 
> Oh may this little loving temporal help led many hearts to partake the feast of a Saviour's love.

## FREE BREAKFASTS AND FREE TEAS.

By the kindness of T. B. Smithies, Esq., and other dear friends, we have been enabled to give several free breakfasts, free teas, &c. The following account of a breakfast given in the East London Theatre is copied from the *Morning Advertiser*, and will, we are sure, be read with interest: —

> Yesterday morning we had the opportunity of attending a breakfast, to which between eight and nine hundred of her Majesty's subjects sat down. The company was select, none but those occupying a certain station in society, and only a small portion of them, having been invited. Although this was a grand and important occasion to those chiefly concerned, and although so large a company was expected, yet neither were any carriage regulations issued by the authorities, nor was any order given as to the garb in which the invited were to come. No confusion was anticipated, and no confusion ensued on this account. The fact was, that few of that multitude would have been able to read such regulations; and if they had been sufficiently advanced in letters to do so, they could only have looked upon them as a bitter sarcasm. Instead of possessing a brougham, probably not one could boast of having a hand-barrow that was his own; and as we approached the crowd assembled round the doors of the East End Theatre, we found that a black coat and the orthodox tabular procured as much respect as the court dress at a Lord Mayor's banquet. We had only to essay to pass through, and half a dozen voices exclaimed, "Make way," not "for my Lord So-and-so," but "for the gentlemen; make way for the gentlemen."
> 
> We were scarcely aware of the nature of the entertainment until we reached the theatre when we were besieged with applications for tickets for the breakfast. Passing along with the others, we observed that as they entered the inner door, each received a slice of buttered plum-cake. It was then within a few minutes of ten o'clock, and the pit was almost filled with adults. Three or four seats next to the stage were occupied by women, and the others were almost entirely in the possession of men. All were furnished with cake, and most of them had brought tin cans, or mugs, or cups; and one or two were fortunate enough to be able to bring a cup and a saucer. The gallery was filled with a similar assembly. In the dress circle and on the stage were a few visitors and benevolent ladies and gentlemen, who had been instrumental in providing the breakfast. Shortly after ten o'clock grace was said, tea and coffee were quickly served out, and the hungry multitude devoted themselves to the dispatch of the food before them.
> 
> The scene presented to the visitor was impressive. The congregation before him consisted of the "residuum" of the population. They had come from the back slums, from fetid courts and alleys, from the casual wards, from the registered lodging-houses, from sleep on door-steps and in railway arches, from highways and by ways. They were a mixed multitude: the negro, the mulatto, and other denizens of distant countries were there. Every variety of features could be pointed out, from the noble and intelligent countenance down to the most repulsive and debased. The agreement, however, as may be imagined, was pretty general in the matter of dress. All were thinly clad, the bulk in rags and tatters. Here and there were to be seen babies at the breast. Good order was preserved throughout, and everybody seemed grateful for what he was receiving. One poor fellow was heard to exclaim, "God Almighty knows when I had such a breakfast;" and when he was told that he should thank God for it, he said, "I do, sir, with all my heart." Another man, between thirty and forty years of age, said he had come from Canada West to take possession of some property, which, he said, belonged to him. He had worked his way hither a few weeks ago; but, on reaching Doctors' Commons, as he had not 2s. 6d in his possession, he was not permitted to see a copy of his grandfather's will.
> 
> An hour and a half having been occupied in this kind of refreshment, proceedings of a different kind commenced. Addresses were delivered by various friends.
> 
> The proceedings did not terminate before half-past one; and, although they had occupied the long period of three hours and a half, all but a very small proportion remained to the end. No disturbance whatever occurred; indeed, it would scarcely seem credible to any but eye-witnesses that such a tatterdemalion, poverty stricken, vicious looking crowd could be marshalled in such order, and sit with such quiet, as did the meeting yesterday at the East End Theatre.
> 
> Mr. Booth, who is the life and soul of the Mission in connexion with which the breakfast was given, was announced to preach later in the day, and the company then separated.

**Historical Context:** This chapter reveals the comprehensive social ministry of Booth's Christian Mission, demonstrating how evangelical work was inseparable from practical relief of poverty. The mothers' meetings combined spiritual nurture with material assistance through clothing clubs and maternal aid. The detailed case studies illustrate the extreme destitution in Victorian London's East End, where converts often lived on parish relief of one shilling per week. The Mission's relief work included Christmas dinners for 500 families, free breakfasts for 800-900 people, temperance societies, and believers' meetings for ongoing spiritual support. This holistic approach to mission—addressing both spiritual and physical needs—would become foundational to Salvation Army methodology worldwide.
