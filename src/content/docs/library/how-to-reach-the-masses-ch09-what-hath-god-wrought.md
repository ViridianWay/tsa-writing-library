# What Hath God Wrought

_From "How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel" by William Booth_

---

What shall we say, then, of the work we have striven to describe, but that it is the Lord's doing, and marvellous in our eyes. Five years and a half ago this Mission had no existence. It was commenced by one individual, a perfect stranger to the teeming thousands among whom he took his stand, not knowing who would lend a hand or give a farthing, and left almost at the outset without a building in which to hold a meeting. It has been carried on without any guarantees for expenditure, and without the patronage or recommendation of any society. It has had to encounter constant persecution, and has been everywhere spoken against. AND YET IT HAS PROSPERED. Strangers have ministered to its funds, and the common people have flocked gladly around its banner. It has now twenty-five preaching stations, twenty persons devote their whole time to it, and the number of those who labour in it according to their opportunity is legion. It conducts over 10,000 services per year, out doors and in; and thereby the Gospel has been preached to hundreds of thousands, multitudes of whom would not otherwise have heard it. In connection with its services there have been, since its commencement, many thousands who have not only been anxious, but, by coming out, have confessed themselves penitent. In connection with its varied branches, hundreds who were formerly drunkards, thieves, liars, atheists, blasphemers, secularists, adulterers — in short, sinners of every grade, washed, clothed, and in their right minds, are now walking in the ways of truth and righteousness. Numbers, saved through its instrumentality, are in different parts of the kingdom or in distant lands, while many, thank God! are safely landed in heaven. It has ministered to the wants of the destitute members of the Lord's family, and to the poor whose only claim upon it was starvation and misery, having clothed the naked, fed the hungry, and stretched out a helping hand in various ways to those that were ready to perish; while it is still going forth to occupy other fields of usefulness. And for every sinner awakened — for every soul washed in the precious blood — for every despairing heart filled with peace — for every miserable home made happy — yea, for all the good that has been accomplished — we ascribe all the

**GLORY AND WISDOM AND THANKSGIVING**
**AND HONOUR AND POWER AND MIGHT UNTO GOD**
**FOR EVER. AMEN.**

This brief but powerful concluding chapter serves as William Booth's doxology for the first five and a half years of the Christian Mission. Written in 1872, it captures the remarkable transformation of what began as one man's solitary mission in East London into a movement operating twenty-five stations with twenty full-time workers conducting over 10,000 services annually. Booth's statistical summary—preaching to "hundreds of thousands," with "many thousands" responding and "hundreds" of former criminals and outcasts now living transformed lives—documents the unprecedented scale of urban evangelistic success. The chapter's structure moves from humble beginnings through obstacles and opposition to triumphant results, culminating in an exuberant biblical doxology that echoes Revelation 7:12. This conclusion encapsulates Booth's conviction that the Mission's success could only be attributed to divine intervention, a theological framework that would shape the Salvation Army's understanding of its calling and methods. The chapter stands as both a historical record of early achievements and a theological statement about God's work among society's most marginalized members.
