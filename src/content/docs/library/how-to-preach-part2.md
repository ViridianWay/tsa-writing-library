# How to Preach Part Two

_From "The Officer, No. 6, June, 1893. Vol. 1" by William Booth_

---

I closed my paper last month very abruptly. It was written in snatches of the night and of the day during my journeyings in Switzerland, and that will account for its abrupt termination and for some of its many imperfections.

When I finished I was speaking of EARNESTNESS in the speaker, and on this subject I must have another word. Without this quality preaching cannot be said to be worthy of the name, and must inevitable fail in gaining its end. That end is the conquest of the heart, and as only the heart can speak with authority to the heart, it follows that unless the heart is in the talk it would be better not to talk at all.

Earnestness, we said, ensures a hearing. People will listen to a man with interest, if he is in dead earnest – if his soul is on fire with his theme – even when they totally disagree with the subject on which he speaks. How much more, then, are they likely to give him careful attention when they accept the truth of what he is saying? Officers, I tell you, and I know something of this matter, that if you feel keenly the weight and burden of your speech, if lips and eyes and countenance alike testify that your soul is in what you are saying, people will listen to you out of doors and indoors. You will have no occasion to complain that the people will not stay to hear you in the open-air or remain until you have finished speaking in your barracks. Your knowledge and education may be very imperfect – your voice and manner may be all unattractive, but a soul on fire will make the people listen wherever you may be or whatever you may have to say.

Earnestness will not only gain attention, but produce conviction in the hearts of those who hear you. True earnestness, as we have said, comes from the heart, it appeals to the heart, and true earnestness alone can reach the heart. Sceptics and indifferentists and all sorts of doubters will believe what you say if you produce the impression that you believe it yourself. And they won't be persuaded that you believe what you are saying yourself, unless you are in earnest. But if they see your soul is in your talk, they will listen, and think, and feel, and pray, and believe, and be saved, just because they see you are a reality. But if you seem to them to be a mere parrot, saying a got-off piece, or going through a performance because you think it is your duty, or that you are doing it for a living; no matter what you, or what you do, they will regard you as a sham, and turn from you in disgust.

Real earnestness will correct a great many of the deficiencies of officers. It will render perfectly unnecessary much that I am writing here. An officer who is in real earnest to glorify God and save souls will, of his own instincts, do almost anything I or anyone else can suggest which has to do with efficiency as a speaker, both as to manner and matter. He will study his Bible and his own heart, and range through all heaven and earth and hell to find arguments and reason's calculated to induce men and women to forsake sin and the devil, to accept mercy and enter the Kingdom of Heaven, and effect right into the very souls of those who hear him.

Oh, this earnestness is a great gift, and a mighty force in the Salvation war, I assure you. Alas, alas, it is none too plentiful; but where possessed, it should be nursed, and fed, and cared for as a great treasure; and where not possessed, it should be sought with tears, and prayers, and every other means that are calculated to obtain it. I would sooner have one simpleminded man or woman to help me in this struggle with evil and the power of darkness, whose soul is

**RED-HOT WITH BURNING ZEAL,**

even if he does not know a letter in a book, and therefore has never read a passage in the Bible, than fifty people full of book lore and the learning of the schools without it. My poor unlettered man would soon learn all he needs for the gathering of thousands to Christ; whereas the fifty whose heads are full of knowledge and "great thoughts" (as they call them) and of conceit as to their ability, while their hearts are empty of this holy flame, would go from town to town leaving the track of darkness and desolation and backsliding and failure behind them.

**EARNESTNESS IS INSPIRATION TO EVERYBODY ELSE.**

The larger proportion of the few soldiers who have cast in their lot with Jesus Christ are a nervous and timid set with respect to daring and desperate action. They are frightened at their own shadow, and everlastingly suffering from a miserable fear either of displeasing God, or their own selves, or someone else. The value and importance of men whose inward sense of the reality and importance of Divine things overpowers the fear of men and consequences, and who can rush forward to the discharge of duty at all risks, cannot be measured. They not only convince the nervous, frightened soldiers of the Cross, but carry them with them, lead them in the fight, compel their admiration and imitation, and so transform them into warriors as brave and as daring as themselves. Earnest men lead the race and rule the world. As we want the race to be led to Christ, and the world to be saved and purified by His blood, we want earnest officers.

Have I gone off the track? I am afraid I have got away from the Earnest Talker to the Earnest Man. Well, I have not gone far astray, so I will let what I have written remain, for there will be no controversy that the earnest officer and soldier will in all human probability be an earnest talker.

## PREPARATION.

Should I prepare for the platform beforehand? is a question, I fancy, many officers have frequently asked themselves, and to which question some at least have never received a satisfactory answer. I confess to having in early life frequently been troubled with the same enquiry, and for a long time was not a little perplexed. I have long since, however, decided upon what is the Lord's will with respect to my own practice, and although I cannot say that I am able to speak as to what should absolutely be the practice of others, I can give my judgment, and officers must decide for themselves.

The most powerful preachers I have known personally, or by reputation, with only one or two exceptions, have been in the habit of making some preparation beforehand. The most effective preacher by far that I came across in my youth, the great Revivalist the Rev. James Caughey, prepared most carefully, although in no way allowing himself to be in bondage to what he had gathered beforehand.

Of course you will know that I should condemn at the outset, and that most strongly, any preparation prompted by any other purpose than that already described. The same single aim, God and souls, which regulates a man's work on the platform, must guide and govern him in the preparation he makes for it, and I cannot see why a man may not walk about his room, or sit down to his table, and say,

> "Oh, God, I am going to that barracks tonight to talk about the duty those deathless souls owe to Thee, to each other, and to mankind. Some of them are travelling to hell, nay, may be at this hour on its very brink. I want to persuade them to flee from the wrath to come by submitting to Thy authority and plunging into the fountain of Jesus' blood. Oh, help me, Thou blessed Spirit, by giving me thoughts and words that will awaken these sleepers, carry conviction to their hearts and bring them to salvation."

I say, I cannot see any reason why God should not answer that prayer as to what I should say to them, by giving light and leading before the time, as truly as at the hour I rise to speak.

And, in addition, it does not seem to be unreasonable that I should make calls upon the truths stored up in my memory, look into my Bible, and even seek for explanations on topics which at the first blush appear dark and difficult from the inspired teaching of other men of God.

Preparation is in harmony with human reason and human action. Men prepare carefully when they want to secure any earthly results. To produce a crop, the farmer prepares the ground for the seed, and prepares the seed before he casts it into the earth.

To effect a cure, the doctor studies the special characteristics of disease, the condition and circumstances of his patients, and refers to the action of other physicians in similar cases.

To obtain a satisfactory verdict, the lawyer studies his case, examines his witnesses, hunts up his arguments, and considers how he is going to order all before the court.

I want to secure a harvest of souls for my Master. I want to effect the cure of the diseased-stricken people who sit before me, and to obtain a verdict from my audience in favor of truth and the claims of Jesus Christ, and it seems only reasonable that I should make such preparation beforehand as will enable me to gain my end and bring conviction to the hearts and consciences of those with whom I have to do.

But it may be said, did not Christ make an express promise bearing upon this question? Did He not say, "But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate; but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye, for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost?"

What does this mean that is promised here? I may say at once, that there is room to question whether this passage refers to preaching in the ordinary sense at all. It simply signifies that when ignorant people are brought before rulers for professing the faith of Jesus Christ, that the Holy Spirit in their hearts will teach them what to say.

For instance, here is a poor woman, or young girl, seized and dragged to prison, and charged with the offence of praying to Jesus Christ. Anxious not only to defend herself, but to speak for her Master and for the benefit of his enemies, how could she tell what to say on such an occasion? The circumstances would be altogether new to her. Probably she has never been in a Court of Justice before, knowing nothing of its forms or usages; therefore no amount of labor or thought on her account would be of any avail. She could make no preparation if she would. Consequently Jesus Christ relieved her from all responsibility on the subject by saying, "Don't trouble yourself as to your defence, or what you shall say to the great men who will examine you, rest patiently; when the hour is come the Holy Spirit will give you the very words that will be likely to be of service to you or to My kingdom."

Now I am not going to say that the blessed Spirit does not help Salvation officers at the very hour when they are talking, and give them words to say to the people direct from the Throne. I believe He does. I believe, as I have said elsewhere, that as holy men of old spake as the Spirit gave them utterance, so He still inspires holy men of modern times with suitable words and arguments.

I believe He frequently pours through me words of burning truth into the ears and hearts of those who hear me – words that I have not the remotest idea beforehand that I am going to use, and words which, if I would, I could never call up to memory to use again. I believe that He has been dealing with me after this fashion during this last few months perhaps as never before, and yet I feel constrained to use such powers as He has given me, and to call to my aid such knowledge as I possess beforehand, in order to shape thoughts and illustrations and scriptures in such form as shall seem most likely to glorify His dear name and bring lost sinners to His feet.

If he sent me to seek a lost sheep in the wilderness, or to pull an ox out of some pit into which he had stumbled in the night, I should endeavor to gain any information not already in my possession which my Employer might possess concerning the duty which He commissioned me to discharge, and I should equally endeavor to use such measures as I was already familiar with and which seemed appropriate to the occasion. He has sent me to seek lost men and women and children wandering in the wilderness of sin and misery, and to pull the wretched backsliders and drunkards and harlots out of the horrible pit into which they have fallen, and to stimulate all true blood-and-fire soldiers to take part in the same blessed task; and while relying on Him for the supply of that wisdom and strength which I possess not, I still feel that it is only reasonable that I should use such knowledge, such arguments, such words, such songs, and such other measures as I already have knowledge of, or which I can by thought and enquiry obtain, and which appear likely to secure the accomplishment of my end.

If any officer, however, says that he needs not to make any such preparation; that God gives him His message direct from heaven, and that at the very time he rises to deliver it; and that signs and wonders follow to be seen of all men standing by, verifying these claims to direct and efficient inspiration, I have nothing to say in opposition; but to those who may not have the same faith, I give such light on the subject as has been given to me.

## HOW MUST I PREPARE.

To this question I reply –

I. Don't make sermons, whether you call them by that name or any other. By a sermon I mean a speech about some passage of Scripture, or some occurrence in New or Old Testament history, with an application to your audience made at the close, or in the middle, or not at all, the whole of which has no direct or immediate application to the present salvation and sanctification, and inspiration with a red-hot religion, of the people who are before you. But I shall have more to say on this topic by-and-by.

II. Don't get up anything like a speech; such as a lot of sentences strung together to be got off by heart, and said to a congregation like a school-boy says his piece. I call that spouting; and anything like spouting is objectionable. Words, whether many or few, committed to memory and repeated over and over again are, as a rule, hateful – especially on a Salvation Army platform, or, as far as that goes, anywhere else. All preachments lose their power over their hearers by repetition, and that simply because they lose their hold upon the mind of the speaker. The life goes out of them that they had at birth, and they become dead tings; and nobody likes to have death hawked before them, whether in the name of religion or anything else.

A few opening sentences learned off may be excusable sometimes with beginners, especially if they are very nervous and timid. It may help to create confidence; but even this is sometimes objectionable. Better by far to get your own ideas well into your head, and throw off, trusting in God for language.

Therefore, beware of making addresses of the patchwork school, composed of alternate texts, books, and other people's thoughts, and anecdotes in general.

III. Beware of simply preparing with a view to show off your ability in any respect whatever.

IV. Beware of going to the platform with anything that will interfere with your perfect freedom of spirit, or bar the way to the fullest communication by the Holy Ghost of ideas to your heart at the moment, or to any leading or teaching you may get from the people before you, during the progress of the meeting, or from the circumstances of the hour.

Now in preparation

**YOUR FIRST WANT IS A TOPIC.**

You want a topic. By a topic I mean some particular subject to which you shall specially address yourself; and the sort of subject you want is, one that has to do with the present duty of those who will hear you; only that kind of subject is worthy of a Salvation officer or suited to a Salvation platform. We have no time for theorizing, or speculation, or general talk. Beware of the habit of saying that which means nothing in particular, and which, although delivered with plenty of energy and sound and outward earnestness, has no meaning of any special importance. Now, what ought your topic to be?

I. It should contain some important truth in itself – some truth which will cling to the memories of your hearers if everything you say about it is forgotten. I have often observed, in my own experience, that a much greater effect has been produced by some definite heavy truth, even when I have been greatly straightened in talking about it, than has seemed to be the case when I have had great liberty of speech and much acceptance with the people on some topic that has not of itself been so important. For instance, no officer can talk about such subjects as The Evil of Sin Here and Hereafter, Salvation to the Uttermost, Purity of Heart, The Universal Obligation of Judgment Day, The Sorrows of Lost Souls, or any other kindred themes, without producing a great impression, if the Holy Spirit is with him, however imperfectly he may discharge his task.

II. Don't talk any more than is necessary about such truths as all are familiar with, and which all profess to believe. That truth which is most uncommon will be most useful. For instance, the immense bulk of the people who attend our meetings readily admit the willingness of God to save them, and are perfectly aware of the freeness, fullness, and sufficiency of Salvation. In fact, the willingness of God to save is, with the multitudes, the reason why they go on sinning, hence time is all but thrown away in pressing these subjects upon them. The sin of the regular salvation hearer and of multitudes outside our ranks is that of presumption. They think that God is so anxious to save them, that they do not need to have the slightest fear of being damned. They consider that they will only have to kneel down and offer a short prayer, or sit down and believe some passage of Scripture, in order to be made perfectly secure for both time and eternity.

There is, therefore, not so much need for any officer to spend his time and strength in setting forth the willingness and ability of God to save. On the contrary, let him show the danger there is of these people being forsaken by the Spirit – sinning away the day of grace – having the things which belong to their peace for ever hidden from their eyes, as was the case with the Jews, being suddenly taken away to death; or let him picture them crying for mercy when Christ won't hear them.

III. You want a subject – a subject that has to do with a present salvation of those very people who will hear you. You want to help them to get saved, to overcome their evil habits, to master the devils with whom they have to fight, and to set them on to fight for God themselves if they have not yet begun to do so.

IV. You want a topic that will attract outsiders. The announcement of it will serve as an advertisement. Then let me caution you to beware of what is merely sensational. I don't care how strongly or strangely it may strike the people beforehand if you can only turn it to good account. Many years ago, when stationed as a minister in the north of England, and casting about for some subject that would draw a crowd, I announced from the pulpit that on the following Sabbath I would preach the "Funeral Sermon of all Saints that had gone from Gateshead to Heaven during the last thirty years." The subject came on and brought the people in all directions, and we had a good time and a number of penitents. I then announced that on the following Sunday I would preach "A Funeral Service for all the sinners who had gone from Gateshead to Hell during the last thirty years." We had on this occasion another packed house and more penitents. Now here are sensational subjects, but they are such as were easily made to tell in favor of salvation there and then.

V. You want a topic that will lead to some present action. You must always keep this in view. This purpose alone will determine the difference between you and ordinary sermonizers. They are content with a discourse that explains some doctrine, or sets forth some duty, or illustrates some piece of biblical history, or something else of the same kind. Not so you; your aim is to bring the very rebels against God who sit before you to His feet there and then; to make those who have already submitted themselves to His control better and happier and holier and more useful; and you want them to decide in favor of these things during that service. Your topic must therefore be such as will lead up to this.

## HOW TO DISCOVER SUCH A TOPIC.

Now you will say, How am I to discover such a subject? I reply, hunt about for it. Pearls are not always found lying about your feet; they are only found after a search, they will pay for it when found. Just so with useful topics.

I. Ask God. Begin always, whether at home or abroad or on the platform, at the right place; and the right place for information as well as for help is the Mercy-seat. Ask the Holy Spirit to guide you.

II. Anticipate the character of your audience. If you are a stranger, enquire. With respect to an audience I invariably ask those who are familiar with the people to tell me its character. It would be ridiculous for me to go off speaking to people as to their duty without knowing their condition. We should think a doctor mad who went into a hospital and began to give orders right away for the distribution of medicine, bandages, poultices, and the like amongst the patients without first enquiring carefully into the condition of each. While we cannot always know or learn the exact-spiritual state of every hearer, we can readily ascertain something as to their general condition, and fix out topic and our treatment of it accordingly.

Supposing that the bulk or any considerable proportion of your audience is composed of unconverted people, your subject must be adapted to them. Nay, if any considerable number consists of the unsaved, you will give them the preference. I always feel constrained to do so; they are the most needy, and I must go not only to those who need me, but to those who need me most.

If they are soldiers, then you want a topic suited to them. That settles the general character of your theme; but you should be more particular still.

III. You must consider the present-time condition of your hearers. It is not enough to find out the general divisions of character. As, for instance, whether saints or soldiers. If unconverted, are they instructed in religion? Are they Gospel-hardened? Are there many backsliders amongst them? or are they utter neglecters of salvation? or, if saved, what is their particular state. Discover and fix your subject accordingly.

Now then, I will suppose you have fixed your topic. How will you treat it? What will you say about it? You want to bring it before your hearers in such order, and so express yourself upon it, that you shall make them think and feel about it just as you think and feel about it yourself. That is your task. If you accomplish that – if you make your congregation think and feel about God and salvation and eternity just as you do yourself, your effort will be a success. If not, your effort will be a failure. No easy task this, I admit; still it can be performed. But how? That is the next question.

This second installment of Booth's preaching instruction continues from Part One, focusing particularly on the practical aspects of sermon preparation. Writing from Switzerland during his travels, Booth emphasizes the crucial role of earnestness in effective preaching and provides detailed guidance on how to prepare without falling into formalism. His approach balances reliance on the Holy Spirit with practical preparation, using vivid analogies from farming, medicine, and law to illustrate his points. The article demonstrates Booth's commitment to soul-winning over academic preaching, offering specific advice on choosing topics that will lead to immediate spiritual action rather than mere intellectual understanding.
