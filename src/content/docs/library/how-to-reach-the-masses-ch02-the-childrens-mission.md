# The Children's Mission

_From "How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel" by William Booth_

---

For many years we have been deeply impressed with the fact that the souls of the children are comparatively neglected, notwithstanding all the money and labour spent by the churches on the Sabbath School. Great pains are taken, we know, to make the children acquainted with the history and theory of Christianity; but their conversion, which is the main thing, seems to us to be sadly and sorely overlooked. That the immediate gathering of the children to Christ is the teacher's work, is recognised, we fear, in very few schools: true, it may be contemplated as a very desirable end, and reckoned on as a possibility at some future time; but it is not the aim of the present moment, and, consequently, little effort is made to bring it about.

The ordinary services of church or chapel which Sabbath school children are compelled to attend, are, as a rule, beyond their mental grasp and intelligence, and, therefore, but little understood, — cold and formal, and, therefore, thoroughly uninteresting; consequently, so soon as the children are left to their own choice, they give up attending the house of God altogether, and not unfrequently exhibit a more bitter opposition to religion that those who have never been familiarised with it. Even when measures are taken to lead the children to Jesus, there are no means of grace adapted to their age and capacity, for the nurture and establishment of their hearts in righteousness; therefore, the impressions produced frequently pass away, greatly discouraging those who have laboured to produce them, and fostering the prevalent unbelief with respect to the conversion of children. Feeling all this, we resolved, that if ever opportunity offered, we would try services as much adapted for the conversion and instruction of children, as our other services are for adults. The opportunity offered, we seized it; God has blessed our effort, and made it a success. We have now two halls, each of which might be termed a CHILDREN'S CHURCH. But we will give a more particular account of the history and working of this department in the words of the brother who is in special charge of it.

> "On the first Sunday afternoon in April, 1869, we held our first " Children's Salvation Service," in our late Hall in the Old Bethnal Green Road, of which meeting the present Children's Mission is the result. At this meeting God was graciously present, and five children professed to find the Saviour.
> 
> "The following day I told Mr. Booth of this precious service, and he recommended me to form the little converts into a believers' class by themselves; which I did. The only place we could obtain for our meetings was a dirty, wet cellar, used for stowing away lumber. This we had cleared out, and fitted up as well as we could, and in it for several mouths we had some most blessed meetings.
> 
> "Soon afterwards similar meetings were commenced at Whitechapel, Limehouse, and Shoreditch. At the latter place, every Sunday night we got together an average attendance of two hundred and fifty children; but here and at Bethnal Green this important work had to be given up for want of suitable promises.
> 
> "At Limehouse, under the direction of a devoted sister, the work is still continued with much of the divine blessing.
> 
> "On the 3rd of April, 1870, we opened a Hall in Thomas Passage, Whitechapel, strictly for children's services, and in it many have been gathered into the fold. Here we meet with the children of costermongers, thieves, drunkards, and such like — all unwashed and in rags. Our congregations are indeed pitiable sights. Long before the hour of opening, the doors are thronged with children, some of them longing to hear again of this Jesus — for we meet with many who never heard His name, except in blasphemy. Some come because of their companions, others to laugh and talk, and others to create a disturbance. We generally succeed, however, in securing their attention, and awakening their interest; and many who come to laugh remain to pray.
> 
> "A few months after the opening of the room in Thomas Passage, we came into possession of an excellent Hall in Fieldgate Street, Whitechapel, which was also set apart for the children's work; and in it, from the beginning, God has been pleased to vouchsafe a wonderful blessing. The Hall is very near our central premises in Whitechapel, will seat four hundred persons, with a large vestry and small cottage for the residence of hall keeper. The whole are in excellent condition, being of recent erection, at a cost of about £600, and having had during the last year over £100 spent in improvements, additional fittings, and furniture.
> 
> "We conduct our children's meetings on the same principle and in a similar manner to the ordinary services held for adults. On the Sunday we commence with a workers' prayer meeting. At 9.30 there is the school, after which two or three short addresses. At 2.30; school again; and in the evening, at 6.30, a preaching service. On Monday also we have a preaching service, whilst every other night of the week is filled up with believers' meetings, prayer meetings, and Band of Hope, all intended and adapted expressly for the children. The Sabbath evening meetings are mostly crowded, and there are over sixty children attending the believers' meetings, who profess faith in Jesus as their Saviour."

The following, while referring to a particular night at Thomas Passage, may he regarded as descriptive of an ordinary Sabbath evening service: —

## A SABBATH EVENING WITH THE LITTLE ONES.

Passing down the Whitechapel Road, with its glaring gin shops and teeming thousands, we turn down North Street, and in a few moments reach Thomas Passage, when we are surrounded by a score young urchins, who together cry out, "Please, Mr. —, mayn't I go to the meeting? The man at the door won't let us in." When we arrive at the little hall, we learn that these are old and incorrigible offenders against order, and so for once are refused admission. Inside we find some 300 children, ranging in age from three to sixteen years. Here and there we find a few respectably dressed, but by far the greater majority are children of the very poorest class. Many come with bare heads, and not a few with bare feet. At half-past six the speaker for the evening gives out a hymn, in which all join heartily. After a short prayer a passage of scripture is read, and then the address is given, which is generally listened to attentively; at times, however, we have to muster up all our patience and forbearance, and occasionally we are compelled to eject an unruly boy.

Now comes our prayer meeting; but, before commencing, the speaker has descended from the platform, and invites those who are desirous of giving their hearts to God to come to the front, that they may be prayed with. The silence at this juncture contrasts remarkably with the noise which greeted us on our entrance. None of the children coming to the front, we sing

> Time is earnest, passing by;
> Death is earnest, drawing nigh,
> Sinner! Wilt thou trifling be?
> Time and death appeal to thee.

A delightful solemnity is felt through the meeting, and we realise that God is present, for when we come to that part of the hymn which reads

> Christ is earnest, bids thee "come,"
> Paid thy spirit's priceless sum,

First one and then another comes forward until the forms around the platform are filled with little ones seeking Jesus.

While the service is going on, we notice in one corner a group of lads evidently greatly interested at something, and on coming up to them, we find that two or three of the boys are amusing the others with white mice and rats, of which they have their pockets filled. While we are remonstrating with them, a little girl pulls our coat, saying, "O do come and talk to this little boy and girl over here." We follow her to the other side of the hall, where we see a little boy and girl weeping bitterly. In answer to an inquiry put by us, the little girl said, "I know Jesus died for me, and I am trying to believe on Him, but I don't feel as I would like to; I want to be as happy as these children here." We told her that that happiness could only be had by believing on Christ with her whole heart. She said, "I've got two or three companions, and I'm very fond of them, but I'd give them up, sir; I'd give up everything for Jesus." Then turning to her brother, she said, "Charlie, we must pray again tonight." She is now resting in the Saviour, and has found the happiness she so longed for.

Space will not admit of me referring to some dozen similar cases which came under our notice this evening. Many who flock to our meetings never before heard of a Saviour, and they listen with amazement when told for the first time that Jesus came and suffered death for them.

The following incidents are culled from among many, illustrating the Lord's dealings with the children: —

## NOT AFRAID TO DIE.

A young lad who had been a source of great annoyance at our meetings, and a dreadful profaner of God's Word, a short time ago died triumphant in the faith. When lying in the London Hospital, evidently dying, he sent a request that I would tell the children that he was "going home." "I'm going home," he said; "but tell them I'm not afraid; and oh, tell them not to swear."

## VISITS TO SICK CHILDREN.

E. was ill with fever. During one of my visits I referred to the meetings on the coming Sunday, when she stopped me by saying, "I don't know that I shall be alive next Sunday, but I have been thinking of this text all the morning, 'The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord.'"

K. was also ill with fever. On going to her bed-side, I asked if she was in much pain, she replied: "Yes! I'm in great pain, but the Lord is very good to me. He has not allowed me to have more pain that I can bear." Some little time afterwards, K., who had been reading of a little boy who under painful circumstances made use of some of Job's language, said, while she tossed about in dreadful agonies, "I can say with that little boy, 'Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.'"

Coming from one of my meetings a few weeks since I called to see W. who had been taken ill. On entering his sick room I said, "Well, W., the Lord has been pleased again to afflict you." He answered, "Yes! But he doeth all things well," and then he repeated a portion of that beautiful hymn,

> God moves in a mysterious way,
> His wonders to perform.

## "IT IS WELL WITH THE CHILD."

A little boy about nine years of age, who some nine months since found Jesus, recently met with an accident which necessitated his undergoing a slight surgical operation. On his return his mother said, "Now, suppose the doctor had cut a vein, and you had bled to death, what would you have done then? " He looked up into her face and replied, " That would have been all right, mother; sudden death, you know, would be sudden glory."

## LITTLE MISSIONARIES.

One Sabbath, whilst we were waiting the arrival of our exhorter, a little boy entered the hall where I sat, and fell into my arms, weeping bitterly. "Oh, sir," he said, "I can't help crying to see those wicked boys in the street. They set a big dog upon us while we were singing." I asked what it was all about, when he answered, "I do want to win some for Jesus." I afterwards found that this little lad and two or three of his companions are in the habit of going from street to street singing, and as the children gather around or crowd to the windows, they now and then stop, and in simple but earnest fashion, call sinners to repentance, and invite them to the services in the hall. I now find that we are largely indebted to these little missionaries for our increasing congregations.

## MY SAILOR BROTHER.

At one of our Sabbath evening services a young lad came to the penitent form in great grief. For some time he was sobbing and weeping bitterly. We spoke to him of the scape-goat bearing away the sins of the children of Israel, and then of Christ who bore his sins on Calvary. He ceased crying, and then looking up, his face beaming with joy, said, "I see it, sir, I see it, He bore away my sins." He burst out in praise to God. But suddenly he seemed again filled with grief, and wept. We asked what it was that so quickly turned his joy into sadness. "O, sir," he said, "my poor sailor brother! He's out on the sea, and he isn't converted." We bade him pray for his brother, and united with him in supplication.

Although the services are strictly for children, yet it is not an unusual thing to see adults sitting by the side of the little ones, and sometimes to see parent and child kneeling together, seeking to know Him whom to know is life eternal.

One Sunday evening a woman brought her young son, who, a short time previously, had been detected in an act of dishonesty; during the service God's Spirit strove with both. The mother saw that she would have to give an account of her doings, as well as the boy, and so, side by side they knelt, sought, and professed pardon.

This is gratifying; but, on the other hand, our hearts are sometimes made to ache by seeing godless parents come, and not only drag their children out of the Hall, but often from their knees.

## A YOUNG EMIGRANT.

One evening there was present a young lad, who was to leave England on the following morning to join his friends in New Zealand. He was graciously led to see how dangerous was the ground upon which he stood, and falling upon his knees in the centre of the Hall he sobbed aloud for mercy. In a little while he rose up, his face beaming with joy, and told us all that God for Christ's sake had pardoned his sins. More than once, when leaving, he turned back to bid us goodbye — to assure us that "all was well," and to promise that, when on board ship, he would be" a little missionary for Jesus." We have since heard from the youth, and are rejoiced to find that he has been kept faithful, and is serving God in his distant home.

We have also regularly organized

## TRACT SOCIETIES,

At several stations, and are seeking to establish them at all. They are useful, finding employment for the young converts, and helping to carry the gospel to the homes of the people. The following is an extract from one report, and shows something of the discouragements and encouragements to be met with in this sphere of labour:

> This interesting work is now being carried on successfully at three of our stations. About fifty brethren and sisters are engaged in distributing two thousand tracts weekly, from house to house. In the face of much discouragement and, at times, persecution, they pursue their way regularly and bravely; and, although most of the streets which they visit bear very bad character, for we aim at taking up the courts and alleys left by surrounding places of worship, they meet with a measure of success. The following are one or two of the experiences of our distributors during the last fortnight:
> 
> Sister A. met with much opposition in her district for some time, the people slamming the doors in her face, and refusing to listen to a word. Her patience was particularly tried at one house. The man was a Sabbath breaker. After continued perseverance, however, she succeeded in getting them to take the tracts, and gaining occasional bits of conversation with the woman. Since this our sister has been delighted to see that he has discontinued Sunday work, and attended the meetings.

## THE HEALING OF A BROKEN HEART.

> The history of one poor woman visited by Sister B. is a sad one, and to have been the means of hearing the good news of the gospel to such a broken heart is indeed a matter for thanksgiving. She lived for nineteen years with a husband who shamefully treated both herself and children. Three separate times she had been in the hospital, first with broken ribs, then with a dislocated ankle, and afterwards with a broken wrist, all as the result of his drunken ill-usage. Her little girl, too, was a cripple for life, from the same cause. Four years ago, he left her with the two children to support. With shattered nerves and little strength, she struggled on, scarcely earning sufficient to sustain them, until, a few weeks since, the last stroke of his brutality came. A kind brother had rendered her some assistance, and had taken the little cripple girl to his home, promising to keep her as long as she lived. The husband, thinking that the boy might some day bring him some money, tore him away from his mother. Heart-broken at hearing no tidings of him, the poor creature gradually wasted away. One morning, her mother met the husband in the street, and asked after the little boy, to which he gruffly replied, "If she wants to see him, she must make haste and come to such a place, for he is to be buried today." Scarcely believing her ears, she hastened to her daughter, and frantically they both ran to the house. Alas, it was too true. The boy, who had so cruelly been compelled to call a strange woman mother, was dead, and she had only arrived in time to see the closed coffin. Compelling them to raise the lid, she fainted across the corpse, inhaled the contagion and was carried senseless away. Fever followed, and whilst hovering betwixt life and death, Sister B. met with her. For a long time she would not be comforted, refusing to believe that there was any mercy for her. At last the consolations of the gospel crept in, and while upon their knees, one morning, she yielded herself to Jesus and found peace. She is now rejoicing in her Saviour. Her words to me were as follows: "I was unhappy, I was wretched; I wanted to die, but I should have gone to hell; but since that dear young woman talked and prayed with me, I have found Jesus. Oh, what a wonderful Saviour He is!"

Another sister writes: —

## SAVED AT LAST.

> Going with my tracts one Sunday, a man to whom I offered one took it and then struck me in the face with it. The Lord helped me, and I did not feel angry, but said, "The Lord bless you." The next door at which I knocked was opened by a young woman who was weeping. I asked her what was the matter; she said her father was dying. I asked to see him, and she took me up stairs. The man was very bad, and looked very unhappy. I asked him if he was saved. He replied, "No." Then I said, "Don't you believe Jesus can save you?" He answered, "No, I'm too bad." "May I pray with you?" I asked. He said, "It's no good; it's too late. I resisted the strivings of the Spirit, and now it's no good." I said, "Praise God, I know He can save you. We'll ask Him." So I prayed, and then sang," The precious blood of Jesus." "That's good," he said; "sing it again." And I sang it again, praying all the while; and the Lord did help me to speak for Him. "Do you believe now that His blood washes you?" I asked. "Oh! I do believe Jesus saves me. I can praise God now."
> 
> I went to see him nearly every day in the week; he was always happy in Jesus. I asked him, the last day I saw him, if he would like to see any one else. "No," he said. "I have found Jesus, and He has pardoned all my sins; and no one can tell me anything better than that." When I called on Sunday he was dead. His daughter said he was so happy when he died, and said, "Tell that young woman, I bless God she ever came to point me to Jesus."

The tract distributor, from whose lips this account was taken, has been carrying on her quiet self-denying work for more than a year, finding her way into the houses of some of the lowest and most depraved. She lives with an ailing mother; and often knows what it is to go whole days without food; but however faint she may be, her work for God is never set aside.

**Historical Context:** This chapter documents William Booth's pioneering work in children's evangelism, establishing dedicated "Children's Churches" in London's East End around 1869-1870. Booth recognized that traditional Sabbath schools focused on religious education rather than immediate conversion, and that regular church services were inappropriate for children. His innovative approach included age-appropriate services, children's prayer meetings, and organized tract distribution by young converts. This work represents an early example of specialized children's ministry and demonstrates the Mission's comprehensive approach to reaching entire families. The detailed testimonies show both the spiritual receptivity of children and the challenging social conditions they faced in Victorian London's poorest districts.
