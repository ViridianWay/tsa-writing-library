# Wesleyan Methodist Conference

_From a Conference Address by William Booth_

---

The Rev. W. Booth, the General of the Salvation Army, was introduced to the Conference. The PRESIDENT, shaking hands with him, said: Mr. Booth, I am very glad to see you, and the Conference will be very glad to hear you. We have no doubt that God is in your work, in the vigour of it, and in the success of it. We shall be glad to hear the story of your success, but I am sorry to say that, owing to the heavy pressure of our business, we cannot afford you as much time as we should like.

Mr. Booth said: Mr. President, fathers and brethren: I may be excused feeling some little trepidation in being placed in this unexpected position. I can easy understand what time means in a Conference like this. I am continually crying time at our meeting, and if our people do not stop we sing them down. I will give you the privilege to do the same with me. I propose to give some information about the Salvation Army as plainly and simply as I can. I cannot help but feel that I am mixed up with a very important movement, and a movement that is worthy of the consideration of all Christian men who are concerned about the salvation of the world. I may say here that I am the child of Methodism, that I was born and cradled in Methodism, that I was converted and trained to love soul—saving work in Methodism. Next to the influence of my own family upon this movement no influence has been greater than that of George Railton. I am sometimes disposed to think that this movement is the continuation of the work of Mr. Wesley, for we have gone on, only a great deal further, on the same lines which he travelled.

Fifteen years ago I fell in love with the great crowds of people who seemed to be outside the pale of all Christian churches. I had been about as an evangelist for some years, but all at once my heart turned towards the people who would not attend evangelists' services. Ninety-five per cent of the population of our large towns and cities never cross the threshold of places of worship, and I thought, cannot something be done to reach these people? I thought if we could get people to think about religion, a great point would be gained. If we could get them to think about hell they would be certain to want to turn from it. If we could get them to think about heaven they would want to go there. If we would get them to think about Christ they would go into his open arms. I thought, is there no way of getting these masses to think on these topics? Their hearts, I knew, were like mine, and the truth was just as enthralling and as potent in their case as in my own, and the Salvation Army is simply the outcome of that resolution put into practice fifteen years ago.

I first took a stand at Whitechapel, with an old ragged tent, which was soon blown down. I replaced it at once by a dancing room in which there was never a seat, and so I went on, struggling about first at one place and then another for the first twelve years.

But three years ago the movement took a more definite, distinct, and army fashion, which it has at the present time. And during the three years our progress has been very remarkable. In 1877, in April, we had 26 stations; in 1879, 81; and in 1880, 162—that is, in something like two years and eight months the number of our stations has gone up to 162. And these are in the principal centres of population throughout the country. We had in 1877, 35 officers or evangelists, in 1880 we had 285, and I suppose if these figures had been brought up to date we should have 300 officers who are prepared to go anywhere or do anything for the Master, wheresoever I think it best for them to go. There is very little question if I were to send a telegram to each of these officers and say, I have come to the conclusion that it would be most for the glory of God that you should move away to such and such a place, without any promise or guarantee of salary, and without the assurance that when they reached their stations they would find any to sympathise with them, the great bulk of them would cheerfully and gladly go. That is a very remarkable statement to make, but it is also a remarkable result of the influence of the Spirit, which makes men willing to suffer, and even to die, for the Saviour. In 1879 we had 1,987 unpaid speakers, and the number has increased to 5,280 persons, who are willing all the year round to speak in the open-air or indoors.

In 1880 the poor people contributed towards the movement £14,680. We go upon the lines of self-sustentation. We say, "Now, get on your feet and say something for God, and put down something for his cause." I have the opinion that we have made some improvement in this matter on the Wesleyan Methodist system of a-penny a-week and a-shilling a-quarter. We say, "You used to give three or four shillings a-week for beer and tobacco, and we won't be content to receive a-penny a-week and a-shilling a-quarter. Give as the Lord has prospered you, and down with your money." Some of the officers had gone into a town not knowing who would give them a farthing, and at a tea-meeting where I was present one of them was making a collection. She made them pay a shilling each for their tea, and then she got up and said, "General, we must have a collection," and she made one. She said, "Whack it into the basket," and they gave her a right good offering. Now, considering that this is a new movement, that really seems to me remarkable. It is a movement that from the poor people has raised £14,680 to sustain itself, and roll, as we sing, the old chariot along elsewhere.

Let me say two or three words as to the principles on which we have proceeded. The first principle is to go to the common people, to the outcasts, to the publicans, and harlots and thieves. We do not fish in other people's waters. We are not chargeable with that. We do not throw our bait to catch a Methodist local preacher or the deacon of a Baptist Church. No, we get our converts out of the gutters, we fish them out of the slush and slime; and if there is one man worse than another we rejoice to be the means of saving that man.

Let me refer to one of the last telegrams I have received. We have just had a dear brother who got the blessing of a clean heart, and, though his friends said they would give him any amount of money if he would preach anywhere else, he loved Christ more than money or friends. At Manchester he found out a notorious atheist and blasphemer and invited him to the service; and this man said, "I am coming here every night, and if ever I do get converted there will be no room big enough in Manchester to hold the crowds that will come to see and hear me." I have just had this telegram from one of the captains: "The great sportsman and atheist is out at the form crying for mercy." Now, that is the style of people we seek to save. I find it a difficult thing to keep my people down to the gutter. When a man gets saved his wife gets his shirt from his "uncle" and buys him a paper collar, &c., and he cannot see the hole of the pit from which he was digged. He would like to make our rough concern into a chapel, and make it more respectable. But that is not our ambition, we are moral scavengers—netting the very sewers, and we want the lowest of the low.

My heart has been going out towards Ireland of late. So I sent a captain, a little woman, and four of her converts, to Ireland. They landed at Belfast. They did not know a soul. A pioneer—which, however, is contrary to our usual custom—had taken them a lodging. We said to her, "Mind you rest yourself till Sunday morning." "But," said she, "we had a cup of tea and a wash," and went about to see what we could do. She met with a Christian gentleman, and through his influence got a mission hall, and now only ten weeks have passed away and we have six different stations in the north of Ireland and two in Belfast. Blessed results have followed.

Now, Mr. President, let me say, first, it is a matter of great thankfulness to God that there is a way—a simple, ready way, a cheap way—to get at the masses.

Secondly, we get at these people by adapting our measures. There is a most bitter prejudice amongst the lower classes against churches and chapels. They will go into a theatre or a warehouse. In one of our villages we used a pawnshop, and they gave it the name of the Salvation Pawnshop. Let me say that as a rule I am not an inventor. I did not invent the term "Hallelujah Lasses." When I first heard of that I was very much shocked. But telegram after telegram brought me word that no building would contain the people that came to hear the Hallelujah Lasses, and that one rough fellow said he would go and hear them because he had a lassie at home, and used to call his wife "lassie" before he was married.

Thirdly, we set the converts to work. As soon as a man gets saved we set him up to say so. One of our lasses was holding a meeting. "What does an ignorant girl like you know about religion?" said one; "I can say the Lord's Prayer in Latin." She replied: "I can say more than that; I can say 'The Lord has saved my soul' in English."

And then we employ women. I may be wrong, but I think we have got Mr. Wesley's authority for it. And we do not guarantee any salaries; and that was Mr. Wesley's usage. And success on the part of our officers is a condition of going on. If a man does not succeed he has to give up. Mr. Wesley did so. If men did not do what they were sent to do in the Revolutionary wars they sent them home and guillotined them. We do the same.

We believe, too, in hard work. We tell them that hard work and holiness will succeed anywhere. Our rules of service are seven meetings on the Sunday and two meetings every night in the week, and on an average not less than three hours' visitation.

And then, lastly, the success of our work is not in its methods—not that we have captains and generals, which are the mere necessities and particular forms of work, not in our flags and banners and music; but it is in the spiritual life which the Lord has been pleased to grant. We go on the three broad lines of repentance, faith, and holiness of heart.

And now if anything I have said should be an encouragement to any here in attacking these lapsed masses, in falling upon them without mercy, and in pulling them out of the fire, I shall greatly rejoice.

The PRESIDENT thanked Mr. Booth for his intensely interesting address. There was the Methodist ring about it, and he was sure he would have the prayers of every man in the Conference that his work might have the blessing of God's smile upon it. Mr. Booth shook hands with the President and withdrew.

This address, delivered to the Wesleyan Methodist Conference in August 1880, represents a significant moment in early Salvation Army history. Speaking before the denomination where he had been "born and cradled," Booth presented the Army's mission to reach "the lapsed masses"—those outside traditional church influence. His emphasis on practical evangelism, the employment of women in ministry, and adaptation of methods to reach the working poor reflects the Army's innovative approach to urban mission in late Victorian England. The positive reception from the Methodist leadership demonstrates the broader evangelical support for Booth's work during this crucial period of the Army's development.
