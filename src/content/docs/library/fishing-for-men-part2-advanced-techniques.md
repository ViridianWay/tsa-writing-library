# Fishing for Men Part 2

_From "Fishing for Men" by William Booth_

---

## Beware of Gossiping Talk

Some people enjoy being talked to; it gratifies their vanity to be made an object of interest, or their love for talking, and they will keep you half an hour, or as long as you like to stay, talking and being talked to, without being conscious of any desire for Salvation, or the most distant intention of seeking it. Beware of these. Anyway, the 'Fisher' should deal with them with all faithfulness, and according to the time and strength he has at command.

## Don't be Put Off

The 'Fisher' must beware of being put off with answers intended simply to get rid of him. He will find this course very common. People will be interested in the Meeting, and desire to remain — but they won't want to be talked to at close quarters, or to make admissions as to needing Salvation.

So when the 'Fisher' comes along with his inquiry, they will smile in the most indifferent manner and say, 'I am all right,' or something that signifies the same. Now, the 'Fisher' must deal seriously with this class, and, if possible make them say definitely whether they are satisfied with their position before God or not.

Again, there is another class who will profess to be all right; or, while admitting that they were wrong, will endeavor to make the 'Fisher' believe that they are not in the least affected by anything that has been said or sung, when the arrow of conviction has entered their souls, and they are all the time smarting from the effects of it.

Now, here again the 'Fisher' must not be deceived, but get to know the real state of feeling and press for the only answer that can satisfy him, namely, the mercy-seat.

## No Arguments

The 'Fisher' must beware of controversy. He must not hold any arguments. He is not there to be put right by any one present, nor to put any one else right so fat as doctrinal opinions go. He may know that the views held and expressed by the individual with whom he is dealing are very wrong, perilous in their effects on Society and on human souls, and a barrier to the action he desires, but that is neither the time nor the place for the 'Fisher' to controvert them.

He must leave these questions alone. He must not trouble about the things that are wrong with the sinner's head, but go directly for his heart. That is his business; if he can get his heart put right the change will have a wonderful and immediate influence on his head.

If they bring him Catholic difficulties, Infidel difficulties, Social difficulties, Salvation Army difficulties, or any other difficulties, and want him to explain them, he must have but one answer, Are you saved? Are you right yourself? Are you satisfied with your own relations to God and your fellows? If not, here is Salvation. You can have mercy now. Come to the penitent-form.

If this will not silence them the 'Fisher' has no alternative but to pass on for the moment. If he gets into an argument a little crowd is certain to gather round, attention is taken off from the main business of the Meeting, and, so far as that part of the building is concerned, soul-saving will come to a stop.

## Stick to your Text

The 'Fisher' must keep those with whom he talks to the one question before them — that is, Salvation. He must not let them go off on a side issue. Sinners will often try to put him off by raising an objection to something in the conduct of the Meeting, or by making out that they distrust the character of some persons taking part in it, or by trying to go off in a discussion on some particular phase of The Salvation Army; but the 'Fisher' must not let them. He must keep them to the point. — 'Are you saved?'

## Drive the Truth Home

When sinners hesitate and don't appear to be very deeply impressed, the 'Fisher' should seek to impress upon them the great truths which are likely to convict them of sin and urge upon them the great motives which ought to induce them to come and be saved. Such as the following:

Is not your life uncertain?
Is not the friendship of God worth having?
Did not Jesus Christ live and die for you?
May not this be the last chance of Salvation you will ever have?

If you get saved tonight is it not all but certain to lead up to the Salvation of others?

If the 'Fisher' discovers that the individual he is talking to is married, he may urge the influence which their decision would exert upon the wife, or the husband. He may ask the question, 'Can you contemplate being parted for ever?' and 'What about the children?'

In all his arguments the 'Fisher' must endeavor to make it plain to the person with whom he is in conversation that the controversy is not between him and them, but between them and God. He may also remind them that he is not pressing them to join The Salvation Army or to do any particular duty, but the point at issue is, will they, or will they not, submit themselves, and do it there and then at the penitent-form.

## The 'Just Now' Man

The 'Fisher' must push the sinner up to decision there and then. He can always reckon upon the devil of procrastination being at work. Perhaps no soul in the history of the world ever decided for God and chose the Way of Life who was not tempted to postpone this duty to some more convenient season. As a rule the sinner will be ready to do anything except submit at the moment. He will offer almost any terms you like if you will only let him off going at once at the feet of Jesus Christ and accepting His Salvation.

He will be willing 'To think about the question,' 'To read a good book,' 'To converse with his religious friends,' or to do anything else, if you will only let him go. But the 'Fisher' must stick to his point. Unconditional surrender on the spot must be on the 'Fishers' lips, and that is — NOW.

I remember being told, when I was a young minister, in the town of Boston, of a preacher who had been very useful in that place a little time before, who, because he was ever urging Salvation on the spot, the people would say of him, when he passed them in the streets, 'There goes the Just Now Man!' Every 'Fisher' should be a 'Just Now Man.'

## Hindrances

When individuals whom the 'Fisher' has reason to believe are truly convicted of sin and really want to be saved refuse to come forward, he should endeavor to find out where the difficulty lies. If he can discover the obstacle he may be able to remove it. He will be more likely to do so when he knows what it is. But how is he to find out?

He may ask the individual for it straight off. But he will find many to be very shy in giving him this information. They will be unwilling to describe the accursed thing which will not let the Saviour take possession of their hearts, so he will have to try some other plan.

He may obtain the information from relatives or friends who are present. But unless they are on the Lord's side and wise on such matters they will be unwilling or unable to disclose the obstacle, even if they know it.

### Is it Worldly Dress?

He may gather an opinion sometimes from the dress or outward appearance of the person. If got up in a very fashionable way, or decked out in jewellery, or the like, it will be safe for him to conclude that the difficulty lies in giving up these and similar things. But it is quite possible to be deceived in this respect, as many people very often dress themselves up to please others, really caring very little about it themselves. If, however, he has reason to think that finery is the difficulty, he can speak of the frivolous and contemptible character of such things when put over against the love of God, the peace that passeth understanding, and the unending joys of Heaven.

### Is it Business?

Sometimes the difficulty will consist of some Business Sacrifice required by a holy life. To those whom you have reason to think are kept back by this obstacle you can push Christ's question, 'What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?'

### Is it Companions?

Or perhaps it will be some Ungodly Companionships that stand in the way. With multitudes the hindrance lies here. They have personal friends who are unfavorable to religion, or they have formed an ungodly engagement, or they have a circle of comrades who would ridicule them were they to profess Salvation, and whom the Holy Spirit tells them plainly must be given up. To such you can press the question, Whether the friendship of God will not give more satisfaction than the friendship of the world?

### Is it Amusements?

With others it will be worldly amusements, the theatre, the concert hall, or some popular game, that has to be forsaken for Christ. When you have this idea, you can tell your own experience, describe how you have tried both sides, and found the amusements of earth contemptible alongside the pleasure derived from the friendship of God and the service of mankind.

### Is it Secret Sin?

Or there may be some sensual indulgence, or some unlawful gratification of the bodily appetites; or some crime or secret sin which they know must be confessed; or, at least, must be renounced. When you are satisfied the difficulty lies here, push home the thoughts of a dying bed and the Judgment Bar.

### Is it Fear of Persecution?

It may be that difficulties are anticipated at home. A husband, a wife, a parent, or even children, are expected to be opposed to the step, and will resent it with bitterness. Being a Christian, especially a Salvationist, to thousands has appeared at such times to represent banishment from home, family, and friends. Thank God, with multitudes of these the choice has been made, cost what it may, 'Christ for me.'

When you have an idea that the difficulty lies here, you can speak of the sacrifices men have made for Christ, such as the martyrs and multitudes of others, and of the satisfaction they have found in doing so. You can quote the text, 'When my father and mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.'

And you can always tell them with great effect of Christ's love for them. How He forsook Heaven and came down and bled and died for them, and ask them if He is not worthy of a little sacrifice on their part.

In dealing with individuals who have been hindered from acting on their convictions from the fear of consequences, I have often described how these fears in hundreds of cases have proved groundless, that instead of their being turned out and forsaken, it has often been a reason for greater affection, and instead of their being condemned and cast away, those from whom the opposition has been anticipated, influenced by their example, have themselves been frequently induced to take the same course and follow the same Master.

With others, perhaps the majority, there is that natural pride of heart which makes submission to God and humiliation before the Cross appear hateful in the extreme.
