# Now You Know: The Rest of The Army's Story

_By Major Frank Duracher_

---

## DEDICATION

To My Paternal Grandparents
Alton & Agnes Duracher,
Who sacrificed much late in life, raised my brother and me
—and ultimately introduced me to The Salvation Army.

## FOREWORD

The Salvation Army has always placed priority on the personal stories of those involved with it. Testimonies, the more colorful the better, were a featured attraction of Army meetings. They soon became recognized as an important feature in Salvation Army publications as well.

General William Booth, founder of The Salvation Army, knew that while it was important to understand theology, the transformation of individual lives also through the telling of their personal stories in three dimensions would be a more compelling argument for most people.

As the Army progressed around the world and became more a part of the fabric of multiple countries, other people came alongside to identify with its mission. Although not formally Salvationists, they joined forces with the Army, as they found that it held something of great interest to them. They became a part of the Army's story.

As Salvationists lived their lives, they encountered a host of situations that they perceived and acted upon differently than they would have otherwise because of their commitment to Christ and their service through The Salvation Army. These became stories within the story.

Inspired by the storytelling of Paul Harvey, the great radio broadcaster of a generation ago, Major Frank Duracher has sought to capture some of these stories. With the vigor of a cub reporter coupled with the skills of a seasoned journalist, Duracher has tracked the stories down. Some are well known. Some had been forgotten. Some have never been told before. This book is a compilation of those stories taken from the frontlines of The Salvation Army around the world.

Major Duracher has brought his considerable skills as a writer to bear, making already interesting stories a delight to read. We thank him for sharing this treasury with the world.

## INTRODUCTION

Hello, Salvationists and friends of The Salvation Army! We know what our story is.

We know how this movement began on Mile End Waste—how Rev. William Booth found "his destiny" and told his beloved "Kate."

We know how we got our name—the stroke of an editing pen changing the word "Volunteer" to "Salvation."

We know about our flag, our crest, and how our generals are chosen.

We even know what a "cartridge" is.

What is most amazing is that for our movement—and the entire church for that matter—it is ironic that God is constantly glorified despite the sin and suffering in the world around us. There must be thousands of stories behind the Story—thousands of ironic twists behind the one larger irony—that our Army continues to bless and minister the Gospel in a most unique way among the world's denominations.

This collection of nearly forgotten anecdotes is more a labor of love than an attempt to place a footnote on history. Many of these true stories are present-day.

As a kid, I greatly admired Paul Harvey, a syndicated national journalist and commentator for many decades. His use of language and intonation impressed me greatly. One of his many "departments" (as he called them) was The Rest of the Story—a short human-interest piece with an ironic twist that most of the time kept the listener's rapt attention until the last moment, when the nugget of little-known fact was skillfully revealed.

Throughout my career as a Salvation Army officer, and particularly during my years of appointments having to do with journalism, I collected stories that fit that pattern of Paul Harvey's style.

Originally, I wanted to call this series The Rest of the Army's Story, but a fear of possible copyright violation prevented me from doing that. Instead, in the spirit until recently, I chose Paul Harvey's other sign-off: "And that's... the rest of the story."

I told stories for several years. During my return to the Publications department of the Army's National Headquarters in 2010, one of my duties was "Intersections," which was a new way to title columns in the War Cry, trying to liven up what every month of the War Cry, a trying to be lovable feature that I tried to capitalize on any national holiday, observance, etc.) and a time suitable for the topic at hand with the rest of us. The Army was always my church.

The column was later transformed into the larger War Cry issues, with again a name adjustment that dropped the I-prefix and returned the word Salvation—resulting in "Salvation Army."

During this long process, I had collected over 100 installments, the first 50 of which are included in this book—now titled Now You Know. To me, the circle of tributes to Mr. Harvey is complete, as he would always end his marvelous stories with "Now you know... the rest of the story."

For the reader's convenience, this group of stories is categorized by subject: Christmas, Salvation Army History, Scripture, etc. This might be an aid for programs conducted in Corps and Adult Rehabilitation Centers as needed.

The fabric of our beloved Army is woven with the blood, sweat and tears of its officers, soldiers and volunteers. The lifeblood that courses through our organization's veins is comprised of people like you and me—willing participants in "this Great Salvation War."

Most of these gems were previously printed over the past 20 years by several Salvation Army publications: War Cry (USA), Warcry (Australia), On Fire (Australia South), Pipeline (Australia East), Southern Spirit (USA South), Young Salvationist, Via Lactam and the USA National Publications web page.

We will uncover incidents from church history—knowing full well that the struggles of the people we will be reading about are no different from ours.

We will even mine nuggets from Scripture—little-known mysteries from the Gospel that are as much a part of who we are as anything else.

So, we owe it to ourselves to share with each other these ironic lessons. More than anything else, this is a look at ourselves. These most poignant moments—some victorious, some on the brink of disaster, most of them, amusing—all a part of our involvement in this miracle we call The Salvation Army.

Now you know.

—Major Frank Duracher

## CHAPTER 1
### A Vow Made at Iwo Jima

More than 70 years ago, a 36-day battle took place—considered by some to be a turning point in the Pacific Theater during World War Two. The battle of Iwo Jima was a bloody encounter for ultimate control of this volcanic island located some 750 miles south of Tokyo. The island's three airstrips, as well as its proximity to the Japanese mainland, made it a prized location for launching subsequent attacks by the Allies upon Japan.

On day five of the five-week siege, the moment when five U.S. Marines and one U.S. Navy corpsman hoisted the American flag atop of Mount Suribachi was captured by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal. The iconic photo became one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war. It is quite possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time.

But on a much more personal level, Iwo Jima is remembered by one Salvationist who made a vow to God during that bloody encounter. He kept that vow, and his lifelong service as a Salvation Army officer is a tale of history worthy of our salute.

Ernie caught a glimpse of that historic flag-raising. He was assigned aboard the USS Mifflin, with two duties: ship's bugler and chaplain's assistant in the sick bay. As the dead and wounded were brought on board, Ernie's unhappy responsibility was to assist in burials at sea.

He made his vow on the very first night of the onslaught.

"I was terribly afraid," Ernie remembers. "I got on my knees in my middle bunk, and I prayed to God that if I should survive this war, I would spend the rest of my life in Christian service."

Ernie meant it. This was not a "foxhole prayer."

The burials were held after midnight so as not to tip off the enemy. The dead were sewn into shrouds and covered by an American flag. Ernie played Taps as each body was committed to the sea.

For Ernie, playing Taps at a burial was always the hardest. "You never got used to it," he says.

After the war, Ernie furthered himself as a music major at Chicago's Northwestern University. An accomplished singer and soloist, he later became a Salvation Army officer.

His subsequent ministry is renowned in all four USA Territories, as his storied career eventually led him to National Headquarters, where he worked closely with five U.S. presidents on public policy (particularly the effort to combat homelessness), predominantly in the Reagan Administration. He retired in 1990 to Asheville, North Carolina, where he still works daily as Community Relations Coordinator for the Army.

God kept His promise. Colonel Ernest Miller survived the war. And Colonel Miller kept his part of the promise as well.

Now, 70 years later, the war is still with him. Although a Christian is commanded by Jesus to forgive one's enemies, Colonel Miller cannot forget what man can do to his fellow man.

"I can still see everything. I remember Iwo Jima. It was part of my vow," Colonel Miller says, shaking his head, and remembering.

## CHAPTER 2
### An NSE Love Story

The National Seminar on Evangelism (NSE) is held every year in early August. Its venue is the breathtaking countryside of Glen Eyrie, Colorado. As the name implies, NSE is a weeklong presentation of instruction and practical application for Salvationists from all four USA Territories to utilize in order to sharpen their skills in evangelism.

One would not necessarily think of NSE as a place to find love—but that is exactly what happened to Majors Mike and Cathy Himes, currently stationed as corps officers in Schenectady, New York.

"We met here at NSE 35 years ago," Mike explains. "Both of us [were] delegates from two different territories."

Mike was at that time the Divisional Music Director in Pittsburgh and Cathy Litherland was a soldier of the Sedalia, Missouri Corps.

"It was love at first sight—at least for me," Mike says laughing. "It took her a little bit longer."

Their fairy tale began early in the week, when Cathy was walking ahead of Mike up a flight of stairs, and she dropped a shoe.

"I quickly picked it up and handed it to her, saying, 'Here's your shoe, Cinderella!'"

"We were assigned to the same evangelism class and even practiced one-on-one witnessing techniques on each other," Cathy adds.

By the end of NSE, they had grown close. Still unsure what God's will for them would be, they decided to make a pact.

"Before we all left, Mike and I sat in the Great Hall and promised each other we'd stay in touch. And remember, this was way before cell phones or computers," she says.

"Yep," Mike chimes in. "It was all payphones and letter writing."

Mike acknowledges the old adage that "absence makes the heart grow fonder." After a month, he drove out to Missouri and asked Cathy to marry him.

She said yes. A year later, they married.

"I had a job (in Pittsburgh), and Cathy was just getting out of school, so after we married, she came to Pennsylvania," Mike says.

A year later, the couple moved to Sedalia and then spent a few years in St. Louis.

When asked to serve as envoys in Ohio, they agreed—soon entering the training college in New York as members of the Followers of Jesus session.

"We've been Salvation Army officers now for over 25 years and have been in four appointments!" Cathy continues.

Mike then lists them as though they were only yesterday: Spring Valley Corps (New York), Divisional Youth Leaders (Western Pennsylvania), Asbury College Student Fellowship Center Directors (Wilmore, KY) and now at Schenectady.

Over the years, Cathy and Mike have returned to NSE—but not at the same time. Cathy taught Child Evangelism and also attended with several of her soldiers. Mike attended with soldiers as well, but it was not until 2016 that they were both assigned as instructors and session facilitators.

And so, this ironic episode of déjà vu came upon this lovely couple as they walked again together through The Castle at Glen Eyrie. They climbed the same staircase where Cathy dropped her shoe, and they sat in the same Great Hall where they said goodbye but promised to give love a chance.

"It's a great feeling to return here with her after all these years," Mike says.

When asked if he recommends NSE as a place to find true love, Mike laughs and asserts, "Sure—what better place to find someone who is like-minded with you about the Lord?"

## CHAPTER 3
### Big Mountain, Small Problem

There are many stunning vistas in the landscape around Glen Eyrie, Colorado—site of The Salvation Army's annual National Seminar on Evangelism (NSE). An early morning hike each day, usually led by CSM Cotton Presley, is a favorite activity of the heartier NSE delegates.

Getting to the hike's apex is only half the fun. Each mountain, each valley seems to have its own inspiration. Sometimes, Presley halts the group, allowing hikers to just "take it all in." Instead of a moment to catch one's breath, one often witnesses a breathtaking panorama.

On one special morning, Presley felt inspired to share an ironic lesson about faith in God. Stopping the group just a few hundred yards into the hike, Presley told them, "Notice how large this mountain looks, and remember this view near the end of our hike."

It was an imposing mountain that seemed to tower over them.

The hike resumed on the inclining trail offering a couple of higher views of the same peak.

"Remember how big that mountain looked before?" Presley asked about 30 minutes later. "That mountain looks a whole lot smaller now from this angle!"

It's true. From a higher precipice, the giant that filled them with awe now seemed like a mere hill.

"If you have a big problem, you have a small god," Presley drove home. "But if you have a big God, you have a small problem!"

Jesus told His followers that faith the size of a tiny mustard seed can move a mountain (Matthew 17:20). In other words, the smallest amount of faith can move a mountain-sized problem.

We don't need a mountain-sized faith to move a mountain-sized problem. We can give it to God and expect Him to move that mountain. Why? Because faith is faith—no matter the size.

Presley's faith-lesson proves that when even the smallest of faith is activated, the size of the mountain is viewed at a much different angle!

## CHAPTER 4
### Drawn to the Heart

A week before Kathy Reichman departed for the National Seminar on Evangelism (NSE) in Glen Eyrie, Colorado, her heart was burdened with her prayers. "Lord, keep me open to learn what You want me to learn..."

"I had no expectations," Kathy admits, "but to discover new ways of approaching people about Christ without scaring them away."

Two thousand miles away, Rebby Lucas had a very similar concern.

"I'm a real 'Jesus freak' straight out of the 1970s," Rebby actively says. "It's hard for me to speak to anyone and not bring up the subject of Jesus! My problem is that I'm too confrontational."

The day finally came for Kathy to come from Salem, Oregon (where she is a soldier of the Ray & Joan Kroc Corps Community Center) and for Rebby to leave her corps in Waterloo, Iowa. They arrived at about the same time in Colorado Springs, which is ironically about midway from their respective hometowns.

That sister-like friendship initiated the moment they met on campus.

"It was the first dinner, and the hostess called me to a table positioning me right next to Rebby," Kathy says. "We struck up a conversation and quickly found we have much in common."

Indeed they do—both are left-handed, both love walking, both have husbands who've undergone kidney transplants, both love coffee (extra hot), both love to read aloud to people and both ladies love large families. Most importantly, they hoped the week of NSE would allow them to develop greater skill of building relationships with people that would help lead to faith in Christ.

"I prayed that the Lord would use my life as a tool to win others for Him," Rebby explains.

Back in Salem, Kathy and her husband have been conducting an outreach ministry in their home, called "Friday Fellowship." She longed to be more intentional by walking across the room to greet a visitor to the corps. She especially has a heart for men and women attending from the Army's Adult Rehabilitation Center (ARC).

"Sometimes I notice when people are struggling, and I want them to feel able to get to know other people in the corps family," she says.

Rebby, who is partially blind from birth, says that she learned much from the Walk Across the Room study (authored by Bill Hybels).

"I asked the Lord, 'Help me to draw people to You and not say anything stupid that would make them instead go further away from You!'" Rebby says.

From the start to the finish of NSE, the two were inseparable. One might think they were long-lost twin sisters who happened to find each other despite the odds.

"After all," Rebby points out, "we have the same Father!"

When the time came for all delegates to leave for home, Kathy and Rebby knew they would "be bawling like babies."

"But we exchanged [email addresses] and will be sure to keep in touch," Rebby adds.

"Rebby and I were drawn to one another's heart," Kathy concludes. "If we don't see each other again on this side of Glory, we certainly will on the other side!

"We'll have some catching up to do."

## CHAPTER 5
### Full Circle

For several years, Karen Miranda has served as the general supervisor for the Adult Rehabilitation Center (ARC) in New Orleans, Louisiana. She's been an employee of the Army there since 2002, but her first contact with the Army came way back in 1968, when she was just six days old. Karen's "full circle" is our showcase testimony today; it shows how God sometimes moves in mysterious ways—His wonders to perform.

"My dad was dying of cancer in Meridian [Mississippi], and I received word that he had 'something important' to tell me," Karen says. "So, my husband and I drove from New Orleans to see him, but when we got there, he was very sick and was not able to say much."

Soon, Karen's dad had passed away, and she went to her father's house to get things in order. That's when she found out what she now calls "the big secret."

"I was going through a drawer and came across a letter addressed to 'The Adoptive Parents of Karen May.' I was stunned to learn that I was adopted!"

So shocking was the news that Karen passed out. When she came to, she washed her face and tried to find out more.

"Your daddy wanted to tell you," a cousin later explained.

Karen's mom and dad were divorced when she was six, and she saw him only a handful of times during her life. When she called her mother, Karen said, "Well, I now know the 'big secret.'"

Karen's mom was surprised that she had been told—it was long before a secret between two young couples was agreed upon.

"It was at the commissary at Keesler Air Force Base that my aunt came upon a young couple who appeared to be quite distressed," Karen explains.

The distressed couple was from New York and ran away to get married and keep her pregnancy from her family. They did marry, but the shame left them in Biloxi, Mississippi with the problem that they could not afford to keep the baby girl.

Karen's aunt looked down the couple's number and quickly were connected to her siblings, who had up until then been unable to conceive.

Ironically, the organization that arranged the adoption in Biloxi was The Salvation Army in existence for "quasi-illegal adoptions," the adoption officer boldly stated, is unusual even for that era.

"I don't know what my parents told me," Karen says. "I kept my adoptive family and I'm okay with it—it was just a shock!"

It is likely a shock as well to the 24 aunts, uncles and first cousins who obviously did not know either that Karen was adopted by her loving family.

"Now that the secret is out, it's ironic that everyone knows the Army I work for is the same that helped change my life when I was as vulnerable as a newborn baby!"

## CHAPTER 6
### Mayor Major

Major Richard Himes has retired Salvation Army officer living in his hometown of Harrison, in West Virginia, serving his entire career with distinction in the USA Eastern Territory. Major Himes returned home upon his retirement in 1999, presumably to enjoy his "golden years."

But now, at the tender age of 83, when Major Himes should perhaps be slowing down—he's been heard the call to a duty in his beloved town of West Milford.

Absolutely no one would blame him for taking it easy. The problem is, he hasn't. In the 18 years since he retired, Major Himes has been a faithful fixture at the nearest corps to West Milford—Clarksburg, a Mountain corps with a rich history of its own. He is Corps Sergeant-Major, a member of the Clarksburg Men's Fellowship Club and the teacher of the Adult Bible class.

He's also been involved in other interests in the Clarksburg/West Milford area.

He is a past-president of the local Lions Club where he is still a member. He also serves on an advisory council for a senior citizens organization and volunteers many hours.

As a younger man, he served in two branches of military service—first in the U.S. Navy, where he saw action aboard an aircraft carrier during the Korean War. After his honorable discharge, Himes decided to do a four-year hitch in the U.S. Air Force. By then, he had married his childhood sweetheart, Judy—literally "the girl next door."

Richard & Judy Himes entered the Bronx training college as members of the Evangelists Session. Following their 31 years as Salvation Army Officers, the couple returned to their roots in Shinnston, West Virginia. They later moved to their present residence in West Milford.

Major Judy Himes was promoted to Glory in 2009.

After serving four (two-year) terms as a member of the West Milford Town Council, he decided to run for Mayor "with the blessing of my fellow council members." The citizens of West Milford narrowly propelled Himes to the town's highest office, although admittedly, this was a nonpartisan election.

"I don't get involved in mudslinging," Mayor Himes says. "I think that if there's anyway you can help, you should step up to the plate."

The Mayor says he believes there's a great need for young people to fill the positions now held by his generation.

"In fact, [even during the election process] I was willing to step aside if a younger man or woman came forward to lead our town," he explains.

Mayor Himes's goals for his term are to finish projects long in the making: repairing the town's Little League ballfield that is in desperate need of renovation, creating a Little League youth baseball program and repairing or installing sidewalks inside the town limits where needed.

Perhaps it was his grandfatherly demeanor that won for him the town's top prize. But when asked if he aspired to run for higher office—say, governor or even president—he just smiled broadly and confessed, "Oh, no. I'm not a politician. I just felt I could do some kind of service for West Milford."

And an irony here—besides the fact that an 83-year-old would take on such a role, when he might be rocking on a porch somewhere or playing bingo? Well, the total number of votes that were cast turned out to be 83—exactly the Major's youthful age. Perhaps this is the start of something big, because now you know this rookie politician's step into faith.

## CHAPTER 7
### Out of Necessity

Ellen Tidman had a problem. In fact, she had two.

She and her husband, Vic, felt strong callings to become Salvation Army officers. The first problem was that technically, she was not yet a soldier. That problem was compounded by the fact that paperwork was already being drawn up for their entry to the Evangeline Booth College in Atlanta, Georgia. Time was of the essence.

The second problem was that she wanted to give the honor of the officer officiating in her enrollment to her father-in-law, A/Captain Sherwood Tidman. The difficulty there was that Vic and Ellen were in Oklahoma, and Sherwood was stationed as a corps officer in Florida. Again, there was little time for advance preparation.

"I gave my heart to Jesus at a Billy Graham Crusade. I was 12 and a member of a Methodist church," she explains. "So, I felt quite natural in devoting my life to His service by the time I grew up and married Vic. In fact, Vic attended the same Methodist church in the first years of marriage."

Ellen goes on to say that Vic also felt a calling to God's service, but that his roots in The Salvation Army were drawing him back to the Army. So naturally, Ellen was drawn as well.

"Captain Ward Matthews was the divisional youth secretary for the [Arkansas-Oklahoma] division, and he was pressing us to complete the process in time for acceptance as cadets for the training college," she says.

So, to solve both problems expeditiously, Captain Sherwood had an idea. It wasn't completely "according to regulations," but there was nothing saying it couldn't be done. The solution was a truth that affirms that "where there's a will, there's a way." But more on that in a moment.

After Ellen's enrollment, the couple spent their summer working at the division's Camp Heart O' Hills. They arrived at the Training College in the fall and were commissioned as lieutenants in June 1963.

Ellen loved interning perhaps most of all, is working with other women who love Jesus and long to see souls saved.

Perhaps the most enduring memory for Major Ellen is how God has blessed her and the Tidmans' service for many years in the USA Southern Territory.

"We were sent to the corps in St. Petersburg, Florida," Major Ellen says, "and then duties cared us around our region."

Major Ellen recalls how the Lord impressed upon her heart to establish a women's international ministry.

"I saw a need for a 'women's weekend,'" she says. "I wanted an event that would be similar to Men in Mission rallies we had in the South. I knew that it could be planned and done. At that time, the Tidmans were the corps officers at Tampa St. Petersburg [Florida] Temple Corps and the project was the USN Southern Territory undertook," she says. The Clearwater [Florida] Corps provided funding to help with the transportation of delegates. One lady came all the way from Vladivostok, which is on the far east coast of Russia." The women's retreat was a huge success, with nearly 100 in attendance.

Many hours, much prayer, and years later, Majors Vic and Ellen Tidman were appointed as corps officers in Salisbury, Maryland—in which appointment they formally retired. She will never forget the Women's Ministries activities she helped promote in Eastern Europe, just as she'll never forget the soldiership enrollment that made her 20+ years of service thus far as an officer possible.

And what of Captain Sherwood's novel idea for that double-daring crisis?

"Let's do it over the phone!" he suggested.

And so they did. In an age long before Skype or texting, Captain Sherwood (in Florida) read each line of the Articles of War over the phone, while Ellen (near Muskogee, Oklahoma)—with her left hand raised and thereafter officially signing her covenant—made her entry into soldiership possible.

"Don't tell anyone we did this," Sherwood jokingly requested after the ceremony ended.

"But he's in Glory now, and I know he wouldn't mind word getting out," Ellen says today.

And neither does the Army mind. I suspect, because now you know about Ellen's determination to follow God's will for her life.

## CHAPTER 8
### Salvo Cyclist

Les Porter has managed to turn tragedy into triumph. In 1987, Les was walking across an intersection when a truck hit him and nearly ended his life. His injuries were so severe that he spent the next 23 days in ICU and five months in hospital.

He suffered several injuries to the right side of his body, but by far the most life-threatening damage was to the right side of his head. At best, the motor functions of his left arm and left leg would be curtailed. How much they would be curtailed remained to be seen.

It would take years to undo damage inflicted on Les in mere matter of milliseconds. As is usual people do after traumatic encounters, Les quickly viewed life through a different lens. Things he had formerly taken for granted now became very important to him.

Even a new life ambition rose from the flames of this near-fatal tragedy. What is that new ambition? Well, that's our comrade's remarkable comeback testimony.

He spent four of the five months in hospital at the Bethesda Hospital—a facility at that time owned by The Salvation Army.

"Prior to my accident, I knew very little about 'the Salvos'—probably the same as much of the general public. But while I was in their hospital care, Salvation Army officers visited me every day. That taught me much about this wonderful organization," Les says.

Les explained that these officer/chaplains frequently asked him if he needed anything.

"Can we do anything for you?"

"Can we get you a magazine?"

"How are you doing?"

That Christlike kindness made a profound impression on Les.

"I have a close family, so I was fortunate, but as often in a trauma, relationships suffer as well. Couples break apart or friends drift off," Les says. "The Salvation Army Officers came in and talked to people who were probably much neglected every day."

Les watched the same scene repeat daily—Salvationists praying with lonely or injured patients and offering words of comfort and support.

As a result, Les came to a decision that whenever he was physically able, he wanted to do something special for The Salvation Army.

"When I came out, I was a lot worse than I am now. I was in a wheelchair for a year, but as my rehab continued, someone told me about these cycles," Les said, pointing to his adult-sized, three-wheeled cycle parked nearby.

The apparatus resembles a reclined cab and would prove to be an excellent form of further rehabilitation and exercise. To Les, however, the adult tricycle represented the opportunity he searched for when he was hospitalized.

It wasn't long before he was pedaling longer distances, and an ambitious plan came to mind.

"I wanted to raise money for Salvo ministries, so I laid out a distance goal of 1,000 km on my map from the Salvo corps in Port Augusta to the corps in Wyndham City [in Victoria, Australia]. It turned out that the distance was actually 1,132 km. I recruited many sponsors for my 'first run' and collected $6,000 for the Army," Les says.

Les biked two more fundraising runs for the Army. He raised $7,000 during his ride from Swan Hill [next to New South Wales] to Werribee [Victoria]—a distance of 600 km.

His third effort for the Army involved a novel approach. Bikers of all sorts in the area urged Les to plan an event locally, so that many could ride with him to raise funds for the Salvos and other charities. Thus, the "Wyndham 1000" was born—a route utilizing a 32-km bike track. Les did the math and found that 32 times around the public bike track would equal just over 1,000 km without ever leaving the Wyndham City limits. The response from supporters and sponsors was phenomenal. The event has become greatly anticipated and continues to gather momentum.

"Another bi-product of Wyndham 1000 is the sense of community it's creating," Les says. Bikers have signed up from local civic clubs, disabled groups and a host of area residents.

Les and his wife, Margaret, are now faithful members of the Wyndham City Corps. The money he continues to raise for the Army has gone to special Salvation Army projects, such as outfitting a bus that goes out every Friday night to feed and care for a homeless population that congregates near the local train station.

Les has become something of a reluctant local hero. His efforts for The Salvation Army are most appreciated, especially among his fellow Salvo members.

But to grasp fully the magnitude of what Les continues to do, consider the limitations he still suffers since his accident over 30 years ago.

Remember the damage to the right side of his brain and the resulting partial-paralysis of his entire left side? That is now a fact of life for Les, and most of the bike-pedaling must be done with his right leg.

"My left leg just comes along for the ride!" he quips.

Imagine how hard it would be to ride a bicycle with only one leg. One appendage doing the work of two would take some getting used to, on top of traveling such distances of more than 1,000 km each time. Some people would equate that with doubling one's effort.

It is an amazing thing to consider, and now you know this bit of our story.

## CHAPTER 9
### Saved at a Bikers' Party!

It's hard to imagine that a person would find Christ as Savior at a bikers' party. After all, that limits the boundaries of spirituality. But stranger things have happened.

Looking at Major Rafael Aspeitia in his captain's uniform at today's Adult Rehabilitation Program (ARP) in Albuquerque, in his mature 50s, one hardly envisions this homespun gentleman on a Harley. Although he still has his Harley which he is quite proud of, on the streets of Albuquerque, in his uniform—he's certainly surprised to learn that this born-again biker turned from gang member to another sort. Also amazing are the circumstances leading to his conversion, which form an incredible testimony of amazing consequence for us to learn.

Back in 1975, Rafael built his first motorcycle. Yes, he built it—from scratch. Buying a frame that he suspects was involved in a or 3 accidents, he installed a chopper engine and transmission.

"I used to ride with a lot of guys, going bar-hopping and getting into trouble—the usual bikers' thing," Major Rafael says. "My lifestyle was out of control."

In the summer of 1979, he was invited to a bikers' party held at the house of a fellow he hardly knew. He recalls that they were "way out in the sticks, so we could be as rowdy as we wanted."

His host asked Rafael if he wanted to smoke "some really good weed."

Now the next part is hard to get your head around, but this is what happened. Out of the blue, Rafael was asked if he had "ever gotten 'turned-on' to God."

"That's not the sort of thing you'd hear at a rowdy bikers' party complete with drugs, booze and loud music," he admits. "But the seed of my eventual faith was planted in my heart that night."

Rafael says that until April 1981, he continued on a collision course with destruction.

"I was bad before, but from 1979 to 1981, I was really bad!"

One night, as he tried to sleep, a voice within him asked, "If you died tonight, where would you spend eternity?"

"It scared me," he says. "I knew that with my lifestyle, I'd go to Hell. I was even afraid to fall asleep at night!"

As the Holy Spirit continued to convict him, Rafael was feeling the Lord urging him to be saved. As his body began to shut down from the smoking and years of drug and alcohol abuse, Rafael got violently sick with a condition he describes as similar to emphysema.

"I began gasping for air," he says, "and right there, by myself, I said to God, 'I really don't know if You exist, but I need Your help. If not, I'm going to die!'"

With that heartfelt cry, Rafael claimed Jesus as his Lord and Savior.

"I felt a peace I cannot describe. The next thing, I reasoned, was that I needed a Bible."

When he finally got one, he couldn't read enough.

"My dad came over one day. He was as big a party animal as I had been. But on this day, Dad noticed a change in me and a smile on my face," Major Rafael says.

Rafael not only had the privilege of leading his dad to the Lord but many in his family as well; all noticed in him a new man in Christ.

He got involved with the county's "Meals on Wheels" program, which led him to meet The Salvation Army in his hometown of Hanford, California.

"It was Thanksgiving Day, and the Corps was feeding everyone, so I took dinners back to some shut-ins he knew."

The Salvation Army officers invited Rafael to church that Sunday, and there he found a warm and welcoming "family"—something he sorely needed.

"They didn't care that I was wearing bikers' grubs," he says. "That didn't matter. That's who I was, and everyone just loved me."

Rafael never thought he'd trade those bikers' grubs for red epaulets and a Salvation Army officer's uniform. Nor could he foresee his dad becoming a Salvation Army soldier—proudly wearing his uniform until his promotion to Glory in 2012.

"God put me on a journey, and The Salvation Army became my church."

After four decades of sobriety and 30 years of ministry alongside his amazing wife, Major Raewyn, the couple oversees an evangelical effort to which Rafael can especially relate.

"I can connect with the men, telling them, 'I've been there! I've done that! And I also know a great God Who comes along side of you and makes a new creature of you.'"

The bike he has now is a 2006 Harley-Davidson Softail Deluxe. On Albuquerque streets, he is a rolling billboard for the Kingdom of God and The Salvation Army.

He admits an eternal truth. "What's kept me all these years is a faith in the Lord Jesus Christ," he insists. "Get into God's Word and let Him have control in your life."

## CHAPTER 10
### Shocking Salvation!

Some people need a "wake-up call" in order for them to turn from destructive lifestyles. Jimmy White was in force the day he finally made him realize about how he'd spent his life and that there was a real opportunity—if not that time to change.

"For that time I was high half a lot of time to think," Jimmy says. "I knew I needed help. So, I came to The Salvation Army. Or, better yet, it seems like God Who brought me here!"

Jimmy considers the two dark decades of his adult life a "nightmare I couldn't wake up from." Those decades were marked by addiction. He tried many things to shake himself free of his additions, but nothing worked.

"Mine was a life of wrong choices and bad decisions," he recalls. "So I sank deeper and deeper. I burned all my bridges—my family, friends and anyone I associated with."

The day finally came—and not a moment too soon—Jimmy says—when his pain was overwhelming him. Jimmy needed a wake-up call, and that wake-up call nearly killed him. He was servicing an air conditioner, when the motor fell into water.

"I was electrocuted," he says now able to break a smile about his near-death encounter. "They say that I'm lucky to be alive!"

The current entered Jimmy's body through his hand and blew out mere millimeters from his heart! The experience, he says, actually shocked him into recovery. But past failures at rehabilitation told him that he couldn't do it on his own. That's when he entered The Salvation Army's Adult Rehabilitation Program (ARP) run by the Albuquerque Citadel Corps.

"I realized that I was powerless over my addiction," he explains—likening his powerlessness over the electrical current that nearly ended his life. "With The Salvation Army's help, I took time to grow spiritually as well as in my recovery."

The Army's ARP gave Jimmy a structured and comprehensive program that combined work therapy, intensive counseling, case management and spiritual care. With his basic needs met, Jimmy was able to concentrate on what really mattered. Jimmy also faced head-on the problems he'd created with his family and others he had mistreated.

While Jimmy was in rehab, he received another "shock" of sorts, says Major Raewyn Aspeitia, Citadel Corps Officer. "He discovered that the child he'd raised as his daughter wasn't [his daughter]. But he's still actively engaged in being a dad to a struggling teenager that isn't his own."

After Jimmy graduated from the program, he became an employee of the ARP and is now one of the resident managers. He's found a life-calling in helping other men make the same journey through recovery and on to redemption in Christ. Jimmy also officially joined The Salvation Army as an adherent of Albuquerque Citadel.

"When I walked through the doors of The Salvation Army, I took my first steps into a new life," Jimmy says.

He acknowledges, "The struggles you go through with addiction are struggles you have to keep working on."

Jimmy wants to show others "the Way" he's found—only without getting electrocuted to do it!

## CHAPTER 11
### Sweet Music

Emily Debnar is an amazing young lady with a "can-do" attitude. Her love for music has propelled her to try a number of instruments, and the teen is making admirable progress on each. This boundless optimism is all the more remarkable given the remarkable irony we are about to learn.

In addition to being a soldier of the Weirton, West Virginia Corps, she loves attending divisional events—including Girl Guard Camp and Music Conservatory at the Maryland & West Virginia Division's Camp Tomahawk.

The annual conservatory lasts several weeks, and it provides fertile ground for Emily to sow her musical skills. She also signs up for as many camp activities as she can—appearing to have as much fun as anyone. There doesn't seem to be anything Emily won't at least try.

Bernie Dake was a guest instructor at MWV Music Conservatory one summer, and he felt blessed to observe Emily's inspiring desire to learn.

"I sat just a few seats away from her during chorus time. As you can imagine, in a choir setting, the object of the group is to sing together and tunefully. When I first heard her, I was overcome with emotion. She was singing her best for the Lord, and I believe that the sound I heard was one of the most beautiful utterances in all my years of music-making," recalls Dake, who works as the Assistant Territorial Music Secretary and Director of Publications and Production for the USA Southern Territory.

As for her future, Emily has set her goals pretty high. After high school, she wants to go to college to become a forensic scientist.

Anyone who knows Emily Debnar cannot help but believe that her "can-do" attitude will propel her to be successful—despite the fact that Emily is deaf!

That's right. Emily was born deaf due to a lack of hairs in her inner ears. She received her first set of hearing aids when she was just two years old. The hearing aids have helped, but she still needs someone to use sign language in order to communicate with others.

At the age of four, she was diagnosed with autism, verbal apraxia and ADHD. Then at the age of seven, she was also diagnosed with OCD and ODD.

Even with these impediments, Emily is very thankful to God for giving her a special gift—the desire and will to never give up doing what she loves to do.

## CHAPTER 12
### The Wrong Floor?

It's a marvelous thing when God uses even the slightest variations from our daily routines to bring about His perfect will—a left turn instead of right, a word spoken (or not!), perhaps even a post or tweet on Facebook or Twitter.

Case in point—Leslie Lovestead is the son of Salvation Army officers Major & Mrs. Lloyd Lovestead. God used Leslie to reopen the Army's work in Taiwan some 23 years after it had been closed by the Communist Chinese government. An otherwise insignificant mistake must have been directed by God to guide Leslie on an event of historic consequence for the international Salvation Army.

The year was 1964, and 19-year-old Leslie wanted to serve our country as a medical corpsman in the U.S. Navy. He arrived at the U.S. Armed Forces recruiting office building in Ocala, Florida, and got on the elevator. Now, whether Leslie pushed the wrong button or simply got off on the wrong floor is a matter of conjecture. The fact is that instead of exiting the elevator on the floor where the Navy recruiters were positioned, he found himself at the office for the Air Force.

That tiny misdirection led Leslie to find God's destiny for his life!

After Leslie completed his basic training, the Air Force sent him to study the Chinese language at Yale University. This was a complete shock to Leslie, as he had never given such a thing any thought. For eight hours each day for an entire year, Leslie was totally immersed in the language, which is among the most difficult in the world to master.

The Air Force gave Leslie orders to proceed to his first tour overseas, which was to Taiwan. The Sunday before he left for Taiwan, his parents prayed for their son at the Ocala Corps and presented him with a Salvation Army flag. Major Lloyd had removed the flag from its staff, folded it and handed it to his son, saying, "I feel God would have me give this to you and ask you to do with it what He wills."

Stationed at the U.S. Air Force base in Shu Lin Kou, Leslie learned that former Salvationists were living in the city of Taichung. Within a few months, Leslie was commuting the 100 miles or so to Taichung to meet with his comrades. They boldly took to the street with Leslie playing an instrument and accompanied by former Officer Liu Hsiu Huo on a bass drum. Out of curiosity, people joined the small parade to a small storefront room where the first Army meeting in 23 years was held.

Leslie paid for the rent and other expenses for the unofficial "corps" out of his own money. He was receiving no connection or financial assistance from International Headquarters, but IHQ took great interest in what the Lord was doing in Taichung. On Wednesday, December 16, 1964, The Salvation Army Taichung Corps was officially dedicated under the same flag given to Leslie before he left the States.

In 1997, Leslie returned to Taiwan to visit the Army he had reignited some 34 years earlier. He found that the Army is still marching forward. Younger generations are following in the footsteps of their pioneers with great zeal and gusto.

This causes us to wonder what would have happened if Leslie had not gotten off on the wrong floor. What if he had realized his "mistake" and taken the elevator one more floor up to the Navy recruiters? What if Leslie were not sensitive to God's leading?

God indeed moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform. We realize this certain truth as we recall the story of Leslie Lovestead and the change in direction ordered by the Lord to bring Taiwan back into the Army fold.

## CHAPTER 13
### Thrift Store Treasure

Shopping in any Salvation Army Family Store can be a rewarding experience. If finding an item at a "bargain basement" price is half the fun, finding something extraordinary, or even rare, could rank as the other half.

Consider the time a Salvationist shopping in a thrift store in Boise, Idaho, stumbled upon a great "bargain" hundreds of miles away. Discovering a bona fide William Booth Award while browsing the bric-a-brac was quite probably the farthest thing from this shopper's mind.

But there it was—a shiny, gold-plated statuette of General Booth obviously well-cared-for by its anonymous owner. It was most likely given to someone for working tirelessly to support The Salvation Army in his or her community—wherever that might have been.

It's not like these things turn up just anywhere. Much consideration, along with proper approvals from both divisional and territorial headquarters, must be given in nominating a worthy recipient. Once a nominee is approved at the territory's highest level, the actual award must be ordered only by the territorial community relations and development departments. The William Booth Award is one of the highest awards that may be conferred by The Salvation Army. Nominees for the award are chosen on the basis of one or more of the following guidelines: outstanding service to the community through the donation of time, expertise and energy; outstanding humanitarian effort within the community; and substantial contributions to the work of The Salvation Army in the offering of time, talent and/or financial resources.

Somehow, the William Booth Award spotted in that Boise thrift store made its way to The Salvation Army's Ray & Joan Kroc Corps Community Center in Salem, Oregon. It became part of an outstanding collection of Salvation Army memorabilia displayed in the lobby entrance to the Salem Kroc Chapel.

Major Robert Lloyd is a retired Salvation Army Officer living in Salem. The major keeps the displays rotated and fresh. In addition to caring for the William Booth Award, the major takes meticulous care to exhibit artifacts relevant to Army history and culture. Epaulets from every Salvation Army rank are represented, as well as antique instruments, printed music and reading material.

"This William Booth Award was rediscovered in, of all places, a thrift store in Boise," Major Lloyd exclaims justifiably. "We don't know to whom it must have been presented, or for what service for Christ rendered by the honoree." Then the major says with a wink, "But we know that person is undoubtedly with the Lord receiving much higher commendations in Heaven!"

## CHAPTER 14
### Transplant Sisters

Major Donna Leedom needed a kidney. Without a donor, her future was uncertain, to say the least. The problem was that Donna's blood type is O negative—making it much harder to find a match. She was placed on a nationwide list, and she hoped and prayed for a miracle.

God sent a miracle, all right—just from an unexpected source.

Enter Angela Windham, who also happens to have O negative blood type. Both ladies agree that what happened over the course of three years was nothing short of God's incredible plan to answer prayer even before prayers were lifted up on Donna's behalf.

"I'm friends on Facebook with Lt. Colonel David Kelly, who along with his wife, Lt. Colonel Naomi Kelly, are very close friends with Donna," Angela says. "I read his heartfelt post on Facebook on Donna's behalf, begging anyone with O negative blood type to consider donating a kidney to save her life."

Angela says that as soon as she read about the blood type, she knew what she had to do.

"I hope that someone would do the same for me," she adds.

Angela privately contacted Donna's doctors and initial testing was begun—all without anyone's knowledge except for Angela's adult children and her mother.

Although Angela and Donna shared the same blood type, the odds of a perfect match were very low.

"90% of O negative people are ruled out," Angela explains, "but tests showed that I fell into that 10% that would match with what Donna needed."

So far, so good.

Another critical factor was concerning Angela. A couple of years prior, she had decided to have a gastric sleeve surgery that helped her to lose 100 pounds.

"God knew I needed to lose that weight in anticipation of this transplant—not because of anything to do with Donna, but because one kidney would not be able to support a five-foot, two-inch person weighing 250 pounds."

Other stringent tests followed, and each time, things looked positive. Each step only confirmed further for Angela that God's hand was in all of this process.

"At the end of June, the doctors came into the examining room grinning from ear-to-ear," Angela says. "They told me that both kidneys were 'a match made in Heaven,' and that either of them would work!"

Not wanting to get Donna's hopes up, the doctors did not inform her for a few weeks thereafter. Angela kept reading posts on Facebook in which people implored others to pray for a donor. "I kept wanting to shout out, 'Don't worry! God's got this!'" Angela recalls.

After Donna's doctors finally delivered the great news to her, Donna phoned Angela—but couldn't even speak because of tears. Angela was driving at the time and had to pull over as she began crying tears of joy, too.

"I couldn't imagine how to thank Angela for this gift!" Donna says. "She asked me not to, and to just live well. That's my intention!"

The operation went without a problem, and Donna's prognosis is excellent.

Despite a nationwide search for the perfect kidney for Donna, the best-possible match came from Angela. Not only was Angela also a Salvationist. She was formerly a member of a corps in Wichita, Kansas, where Major Donna once pastored. Most ironically, at the time of the transplant process, Angela and Donna were living only a few miles apart!

"I attend the Alexandria [Virginia] Corps and Angela was going to the corps in nearby Fairfax," Donna says with a healthy shine on her face. "And we were overwhelmed by the wave of prayer that covered us—people who knew us and those who only knew of the need. Even members of the medical team lifted us in prayer, calling on their church members to join them on our behalf!"

Now that part of Angela is now a part of Donna, the two women consider themselves something like sisters. In keeping with Angela's keen sense of humor, she even named the kidney "Beatrice."

These "transplant sisters" also agree that God had everything "worked out, every step along the way!"

## CHAPTER 15
### World Record

Dave Jones, of Madisonville, Kentucky, will be the first to tell you that God has a sense of humor. He'll also tell you how God used Dave's desire to quit smoking to increase his faith beyond his wildest imagination.

"I had no idea when I decided I had to quit smoking in 2012 that the Lord would take me on a path that would eventually lead to setting a world record," Dave admits. "That 1,600-mile path to a world record qualifies Dave's story as a witness that points directly to God's love for all of us.

Dave is an Advisory Board member for The Salvation Army in Madisonville. He and his family attend the corps for worship on Sundays, and his mother is a soldier of that corps.

At one time, Dave weighed 285 pounds and smoked two packs of cigarettes a day.

"I was hopelessly addicted to nicotine, so I decided to play this game with myself: which was basically deciding what I disliked the most and then use that as punishment," Dave explains. "Every single time that I got a nicotine urge, I stood up and took off running," he says. "I still hate to run, but it's gotten easier over time."

That was October 2012. The more he ran, the less he craved nicotine, and the pounds began to melt off. These days, he tips the scale at about 195 pounds.

Calling his anti-nicotine strategy "my inner drill sergeant," Dave quickly came to know a greater benefit than just breaking a nasty habit. His walk with the Lord has mushroomed beyond what he imagined possible.

"I've found that my life is all about surrender to God's will," he says. "His strength is made perfect in my weakness. The weaker I become, the more He is glorified!"

Dave completed two Ironman Triathlons in 2015 and 2016, and since 2012, he has run in countless marathons. His biggest challenge, however, came during 2017.

"I decided to run in marathons in all 50 states and on all seven continents—eight if you count Zealandia [a newly-discovered land mass mostly submerged in the South Pacific Ocean]. And to qualify as a world record, all of my U.S. races had to be completed within 365 days, and the seven continents within seven days!"

Covering all 50 states within the span of a year was challenging enough, but coordinating the 777 Quest (seven marathons on seven continents within seven days) proved to be—well, a marathon in itself.

Crisscrossing the globe within a week was made barely possible by negotiating the various time zones. Beginning in Perth, Australia, on January 25, Dave went on to run in marathons located in: Singapore (1/26); Cairo, Egypt (1/27); Amsterdam, The Netherlands (1/28); New York City (1/29); Punta Arenas, Chile (1/30); and King George Island, Antarctica (1/31).

"I very nearly missed the Zealandia [marathon], but a fellow marathoner kept goading me to fly down to Auckland for a race fortunately scheduled for that last day."

From the starting gun in Perth until the finish line in Auckland, 166 hours, 54 minutes, 11 seconds elapsed—a mere hour, six minutes and 49 seconds to spare of the 168 total hours in seven days!

"There were times when I had nothing left. My strength had to come from God!"

Dave's faith has grown exponentially with each step, and his communion with God is deep like the oceans he's crossed to make his testimony to the world relevant.

Dave founded his own extreme-sports company, called "Eternal Endurance." He's appeared on radio and television, and he remains busy sharing his testimony to youth groups and churches around the world.

Dave knows that, instead of running from his addiction, he's been running toward a deeper and more intimate relationship with God.
