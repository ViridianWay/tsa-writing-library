# On Salvation Women

_From "Short Articles & Practical Guidance" by William Booth_

---

September, 1901

My Dear Comrades,

I am writing this week on a subject that lies very near my heart, and to which I invite your particular attention, and that is the position and opportunities possessed by woman in The Army.

Perhaps some will think that it is more particularly a topic for the consideration of officers; and so it is, and I propose writing them on it at my first opportunity; meanwhile, I hope that the officers of your corps will pay special attention to what I am about to say to you. But, most of all, I think the subject concerns you.

For instance: If the married officers' wives and daughters do not have a fair opportunity of speaking for their Lord, and helping to push forward the salvation chariot, and if they are not made well one as soldiers to do it, what a loss to the world and the kingdom it is!

But that would not be anything like so serious a calamity as it would be for the liberties and opportunities of one hundred thousand woman soldiers laboring for Christ to be interfered with, or to any extent taken away. No; this is a soldier's question.

Moreover, it has a deep interest to many soldiers on account off their children. What will you do with your girls? I do not say, make officers of them all. That would be impossible. Many of them will not have the necessary gifts, or the needed strength. But what I plead for is that they shall have an open door for the exercise of such gifts as they do or will possess, and that they shall be watched over and trained for filling such opportunities as the world around them will present.

I looked at a young girl alongside me on the platform the other night. She had an interesting face and a beautiful voice, and was singing like an angel. I suppose she was about seventeen or eighteen years of age, and I thought of all she might be encouraged and taught to do for Jesus Christ if the soldiers were faithful to her, until my heart burned with desire to help her to fill the possibilities and reach the position that I saw was possible to her.

That girl represented thousands — nay, tens of thousands in The Army. I was in a certain city on the continent the other day, all in uniform, behind and immediately around me. After looking at them, I said to the commissioner who was with me, "What shall we say to these girls? Shall we tell them that they are to grow up and settle down to the idea that the back door drudgery of the corps is all that lies before them? that they can give and collect, and do the tea meetings, and Harvest Festivals? That they can have husbands and children, and keep their homes in order with a little singing, and a prayer, and a testimony or two thrown in now and then? Or shall we say to them, "Come along, wives and daughters, and sisters; come along and take your stand by our side on the Salvation Army platform. Here at least shall there be Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. For on that blessed sanctified elevation there is neither male or female. You are all 'one in Christ Jesus.'"

On the question of woman's sight to speak and work for God, The Army has taken a bold and unmistakable stand, and that on the highest possible grounds. Listen to what the Orders and Regulations for Staff Officers say on the subject. I will only make a brief extract or two:

**Female Officers**

1. "One of the leading principles upon which The Army is based is the right of the woman to an equal share with man in the great work of publishing salvation to the world. By an unalterable provision of our Foundation Deed, she can hold any position of authority or power in The Army, from that of a local officer to that of the General."

2. "This principle must be acted upon by all officers in their dealings with women. It is founded upon the claims and sanctions of the Bible on her behalf, and upon the remarkable ability she possesses for managing the affairs of the War, and for influencing the hearts and consciences of the people for God. Moreover, the marvelous part woman has played in our history, the enormous influence which the exercise of her gifts and the self-sacrifice of her labours have won for us, should secure for her in the future that place in our councils and our campaigns which she has enjoyed in the past. Only a mean spirit of envy and jealousy, hateful to God and man, will allow her to toil in the background, and deprive her of those honours and that recognition to which she is entitled."

3. "Let it therefore be understood that no woman is to be kept back from any position of power or influence merely on account of her sex."

Look, my comrades, at the example of my dear wife. What a beautiful life she lived, what mighty influence she wielded, and what thousands of souls she was the means of winning to Christ, and holiness, and usefulness, and heaven.

Had she yielded to the vulgar prejudice that was so strong against her in the days when she first opened her lips for the Lord, and sat silent while the the Devil was raging, and the Church was starving, and the people were perishing, what a calamity it would have been!

Suppose that I had refused her permission to testify for Christ in public. Suppose that I had been unwilling to be deprived of her company, or to suffer other little personal inconveniences, in order that she might have the opportunity of preaching salvation, and bringing honour to her Saviour, as many husbands would have done; some of whom are to be found, I am afraid, in The Salvation Army. Suppose that I had been unwilling that she should have stood up before the world as she did, almost alone, would it not have been a crying shame?

Had I refused her the privilege of being a public woman, that wonderful career would never have been lived; that wonderful example would never have been presented to the eyes of men and women of high and low degree; that remarkable death-bed of victory would never have taken the attention of the world; and perhaps, nay, it is quite probable, that The Salvation Army, with all the light and love and blessing it has brought to hundreds and thousands, you may safely say millions of people, would never have existed. What a calamity it would have been, would it not, my Comrades? What do you say?

Now, having looked at the mother, I want you to look at her daughters. Would anyone who knows them, and who has only a faint idea of what they have been doing for this poor world since they were able to do anything at all, have kept them back, or hindered them getting to the front of the fight? I do not think so.

It is quite true that they are officers today; but, like nearly all our brave successful officers, before they belonged to that honourable class, they had done, as soldiers, much solid and self-sacrificing work. Before they were officers they fought in the slums, bombarded the public-houses, struggled with the juniors, held meetings — big and little — in the barracks, and specially battled in the open-air. All this led up to the position they fill today.

It is true that, like their mother, they were gifted. But are not all women gifted? If not all to the same extent, the majority are gifted to fill some important sphere, and bring about some precious results. I want you to help them.

Look at your mothers, and wives, and daughters, and comrades. See what they have done, and are doing today, for Christ in the crowded cities and scattered villages of your own country! See what they have done in the back blocks, and among the scattered populations of other countries! See what they have done among the heathen populations of India, and among the native races of Africa, New Zealand, and elsewhere! See what they have done among the sick, and the poor and outcast classes! See what salvation women have done for the rescue of their own poor fallen sisters! Verily the track they have travelled has been one of light, and their record has been the blessing of multitudes who were ready to perish, and their reward is on high.

Is there a soldier who could possibly wish that any one of these angel-women should not have toiled, and wept, and prayed, in order that this wonderful work might have been done? No, there is not one. So let us do all we can to encourage and help forward the sisters who are on the fighting-line, and do all we can to encourage others to come along and join them.

**Historical Note:** This letter represents a remarkable document in the history of women's rights within Christianity and demonstrates The Salvation Army's progressive stance on gender equality in 1901. Written just a few years after Catherine Booth's death in 1890, William Booth defends and promotes the equal participation of women in all levels of ministry and leadership, citing both biblical authority and practical effectiveness. The letter reveals how The Salvation Army's Foundation Deed enshrined women's equality as an "unalterable provision," making it one of the most progressive religious organizations of its era regarding women's rights. Booth's passionate defense of his wife's public ministry and his daughters' work illustrates how personal conviction combined with theological principle to create institutional change that was decades ahead of its time.
