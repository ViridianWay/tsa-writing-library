## CHAPTER 37
### Santa Wore Red Epaulets

Agnes and Alton had already raised their family. They had pastored the Redeemer Assembly of God for two decades, and now, it was time to retire. As they were well into their 60s, the thought of spending those "golden years" together must have been most appealing.

From out of the blue, two grandsons were on their doorstep needing a place to live. Agnes and Alton suddenly found themselves saddled with the prospect of raising two toddlers—one of whom went on to become a Salvation Army officer, in part because of what happened in that little family one magical Christmas.

It just so happens that the boys appeared about the time Agnes and Alton had resigned from their church pastorate. One order of business was to find a church to attend. Now that the boys were here, this became more of an issue.

It was at this point that someone invited Agnes to the Home League (called today Women's Ministries) at the local Salvation Army corps. She went and loved the Army from the start. She was told that the following week, a Vacation Bible School was being held—ideal for the two boys. Naturally, an invitation followed to Sunday school and Sunday worship services.

The new little family was soon immersed in everything the corps had to offer.

A few years later, the corps officer offered the older boy an old cornet and a chance to learn music. He jumped at that chance. The boy would one day attribute his staying in school and out of trouble to playing in the corps band all those years, in addition to his school band throughout middle and high school.

Agnes and Alton quickly became stalwarts of local leadership in the corps. Alton became Corps Sergeant-Major. Agnes became Home League Secretary. She played the piano; he helped keep the corps (financial) books. They both taught classes and were mainstays in the league (Emergency Disaster Services) work.

For Agnes, involvement in The Salvation Army was the realization of a childhood dream. When she was about seven years old, she came upon a band of Salvationists on the street corner holding a meeting. She wanted to join back then, but her parents would not allow it. She simply suppressed that calling— rekindled some 50 years later.

Agnes and Alton wore their uniforms proudly for everything—from cleaning the corps building, to corps leadership, to disaster work.

Agnes particularly enjoyed helping at Christmas time. Every year, she helped take applications from needy families. She gave many hours on the kettles and distributing the Christmas War Cry. But she enjoyed working in the Army's toy store most.

One Christmas was particularly lean for Agnes and Alton. Raising two boys was more expensive than they remembered, and in some ways more difficult even than when they raised their daughter and son during the Depression. That Christmas, they decided to sacrifice their gifts for each other in order to provide Christmas for the boys—but even that would be spartan.

It was for this reason that at the end of the last day of toy distribution, Agnes spied a football for the older boy and a toy truck for the younger. "Could I please have these two things for my boys?" she asked the Captain.

How could he refuse? The Captain insisted that she not only take those two items but a few others as well—and some candy and fruit.

It would be a glorious Christmas after all.

That Christmas morning, the two boys awoke and found a treasure beneath the tree. Santa had come, and their joy knew no bounds!

But it was that football which was most loved and most used by the older boy. Agnes knew it would be.

"I still have that football," he says.

"After all these years, I realize that the only red my Santa wore was red epaulets—the corps officer being my real benefactor that Christmas.

"When I became a man, I knew what I wanted to do with my life.

"I thank God for my grandparents, Agnes and Alton Duracher. I thank God for The Salvation Army. And I thank Him for an old, worn-out football that I take out of my trunk every now and then to remind myself of the greatest irony of my life."

## CHAPTER 38
### The Christmas Training College

Walter Vis was a boy growing up in Amsterdam. Walter's family was so poor that for one Christmas, it appeared a certainty there would be no Christmas dinner. There was even concern that the family would have no dinner at all. Walter's mom was beside herself with despair.

A knock on the front door signaled a Christmas miracle for the little family—just as another miracle, on another Christmas years into Walter's future, would serve to qualify as an incredible Now You Know chapter.

Walter and his mother hurried to answer the door, and upon opening it, they found a large hamper containing every kind of grocery needed for a Christmas feast. As if by instinct, Walter's eyes darted around to identify whomever it was making such a joyous delivery. At that moment, the large Salvation Army bonnet, and its wearer, vanished behind the stairs of the block of flats.

Walter regarded her as a "Christmas angel, clad in navy blue."

"That's the lady from The Salvation Army," Walter's mom whispered to him.

Walter grew up to become a seaman, and his ship often sailed down the western coast of South America. Someone gave him an investment tip on one of his voyages to Chile—shares in the fledgling national oil company. No oil had as of yet been discovered, and the shares were very cheap. Walter made his initial investment into a bank in Valparaiso—adding more shares each time his ship returned to that port.

Fast forward still many more years, and Walter was happily married and living with his wife in their retirement home in Maidenhead, in the southeast of England. By that time, oil had indeed been discovered, and Walter's dirt-cheap stock was now very valuable. In their golden years, the couple already enjoyed a comfortable living, but to get their affairs in order, they inquired about arranging for the oil shares to be transferred to England.

Too much red-tape—it would be much easier, they decided, to arrange for a donation to some worthy cause located in Chile.

But which worthy cause?

Walter never forgot about his bonneted Christmas angel, and he suggested to his wife that they consider The Salvation Army.

Was there even a Salvation Army in Chile? they wondered aloud.

Oh, there most certainly was. For half a world away, at that time, Lt. Colonel (later General) John Larsson was Chief Secretary for the South America West Territory. One of the greatest prayer concerns for the Army in Chile, Peru and Bolivia was to secure an adequate Training College.

"The existing building was simply a terraced residential house that had been adapted as best as possible; but was wholly inadequate. As a territory, we regularly prayed that the necessary resources might become available. We kept wondering when the answer would come," General Larsson later wrote in his autobiography, Saying Yes to Life.

Back in England, God was already at work. The Vis's had no connection to the Army there but pondered the possibilities of finding out if indeed there was a work going on in Chile.

They didn't have to wait long. The next morning, Sunday, a 25-piece Salvation Army Band, from the nearby Maidenhead Corps, randomly chose to conduct that morning's open-air meeting on the couple's street.

Truth be known, there was nothing random about it—God was at work with a strategic plan already in place for a new South America West Training College.

Mrs. Vis gave her reassuring smile to Walter that this, indeed, was a sign of confirmation. The Salvation Army in Chile—if there was one—would be the recipient of a "Thank You" that took Walter over 50 years to send. It would be a "thank you" for a Christmas food basket left on a Dutch family's doorstep by an anonymous "Sally-Ann."

Walter ventured out to the street corner, chatted with the corps officer, and asked the inevitable question. Within a day or two, the corps officer was in touch with Walter and gave him the Army's territorial address in Santiago.

Not long afterward, Colonel Larsson came upon a crumpled, otherwise-insignificant envelope in the morning mail at THQ. He noticed the postage stamp was from England, and that the address was written in longhand.

"The letter was brief and matter-of-fact," General Larsson later described. "He was writing to say that he had some oil shares in the national petroleum company of Chile and that these were deposited in a Valparaiso bank. He wished to donate the shares to The Salvation Army of Chile. And, that was that."

The General notes that neither an indication of the stock's worth nor the reason why the unexpected donation came to pass were mentioned. As can be expected with any international transaction, a series of legalities proved annoying, and Larsson wondered at times if the transaction would ever clear.

As if by perfect timing, the transfer was completed. Colonel Ruben Nuesch, Territorial Commander, went to the bank and returned to THQ with the precious shares in his briefcase—on Christmas Eve.

One year later, the new Training College opened. Mr. and Mrs. Vis were invited to Chile for the opening ceremony but did not feel able to attend. However, their generous gift is now honored by a plaque at the entrance hall of the Training College.

Mr. and Mrs. Vis were able to accept the invitation to meet for tea with General and Mrs. Jarl Wahlstrom at IHQ. General Wahlstrom expressed the Army's gratitude for their gift.

But the real gratitude that Christmas was on the part of Walter Vis—thankful for a Salvation Army lass who saved Christmas for him in Amsterdam many years ago in his childhood.

This yuletide incident involves a simple Christmas box of food that blossomed into another yuletide miracle in South America—an answer to a territory's fervent prayer, and a loving gift to the Babe of Bethlehem.

## CHAPTER 39
### This Santa Wore Blue

Major Cecil Brown was a product of the western North Carolina mountainous region. Salvation Army historians will forever link her with efforts among the very people she called family and neighbors in that remote region.

Sparse were the people of Appalachia 100+ years ago that they barely noticed the Great Depression that crippled economically the rest of the United States in the 1930s.

While growing up, Cecil and her family were too poor to afford school. And so it was that as an adult, armed with a lieutenant's commission and a conditional mandate from her divisional commander, Cecil Brown set out to lift her people in a "smoky mountain high"—leading them to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and improving their status as citizens of the 20th Century.

Once Cecil was in a position to do something, every Christmas became infinitely more special than ever before. The story of what she did—and how she did it—will bring us inspiration during this Christmas season.

Lieutenant Cecil wanted the children of her mountains to enjoy what she had missed. Since many mountain families lacked trees and decorations, they would celebrate Christmas at one of nearly a dozen corps she founded during her years in ministry there.

Cecil made sure every corps had a Christmas party, and she encouraged the people to exchange gifts as part of the celebration of Christ's birth. In an upstairs room at her main headquarters, she kept reserves of toys and supplies she'd accumulated all year. This became known as "the Christmas Room."

Men usually received handkerchiefs and a tie; women unwrapped gifts of handbags, aprons and kitchen items. The children, of course, were always thrilled with an assortment of toys.

When families weren't able to make it to one of Cecil's corps, Cecil took Christmas to them. Some mountain children came to know her by the nickname "Mrs. Claus." But this "Kringle" was the opposite, in some ways, to the Santa most of us know.

Santa is fat; Cecil was (very) slim. Santa wears red; Cecil wore blue (the uniform of The Salvation Army). Santa's hat is a red stocking cap trimmed in white fur; Cecil's hat was a Salvation Army bonnet.

But the most astounding difference between Major Cecil Brown and her counterpart, St. Nick, is the mode of transportation used by each as they deliver their gifts to even the remotest hollow of western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. While Santa uses reindeer, Cecil relied on her horse, Dolly, to make her rounds! In fact, in the last years of her life, she was given a jeep to negotiate the rough terrain. But even when the terrain was too rough for the jeep, Cecil would set out on foot!

And now you know a Christmas tale, incredibly still fondly remembered by those children, who are now themselves aged. They will always be grateful for Mrs. Claus, who never failed to visit them on Christmas Eve.

**Historical Context Note:** This third section, "Now You Know: Some Christmas Tales," presents three heartwarming Christmas stories that exemplify The Salvation Army's enduring tradition of bringing hope and joy during the holiday season. These tales span different eras and continents—from a family's Christmas miracle in Depression-era America, to a seaman's decades-delayed gratitude that funded a Training College in South America, to a mountain missionary's creative Christmas ministry in Appalachian communities. Each story demonstrates how The Salvation Army's Christmas work extends far beyond the familiar red kettles and bell ringers, touching lives through personal sacrifice, international connections, and innovative ministry approaches. These accounts remind us that the Army's Christmas mission has always been about more than providing material gifts—it's about embodying the love of Christ and creating lasting memories that can shape entire lifetimes and generations of service.
