# Report of the Christian Mission

_From "How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel" by William Booth_

---

## ITS COMMENCEMENT.

This Mission had its origin in a few services held in a tent in Whitechapel. No plan had been laid down for future operations. A week's evangelistic work only was intended, and then the writer proposed to leave for a distant field of labour; but the blessing vouchsafed was so striking, and the harvest so promising, that the friends who gathered round urged him to make the East of London a permanent sphere of labour.

The call seemed to come to us from God, and from the souls of hundreds of thousands of dying men and women, sunk in poverty and misery. And after much prayer, deliberation, and conference, we accepted it, and settled down in this desolate and destitute part of the vineyard. All that follows in this report descriptive of what the Master has wrought through the Mission has grown out of this small beginning.

## THE OBJECT OF THE MISSION.

Our purpose is to go out into the highways and hedges, and bring in the thousands who at present seem to be outside the pale of all religious influence and operation; who, if not positively and bitterly opposed to Christianity, are totally indifferent to it. In the East of London there are multitudes in the grossest heathen darkness, being not only without God, but also without any knowledge of Him, or of the way of salvation by faith in Jesus Christ. Turn which way you will, you may walk for miles, and everywhere you will find a dense population given up to all kinds of wickedness. Here are infidels, drunkards, thieves, harlots, gamblers, blasphemers, and pleasure-seekers without number. To use the words of a popular writer intimately acquainted with the habits of the poor, 

> "We hear of streets in which every door would be thrown open for the shelter of a thief. We see, on little lots of waste land, groups of men and boys gambling. We hear terrible language even from young children. Of the teeming multitudes who crowd the squalid homes, if homes they can be called, which fill our Whitechapel courts and lanes, comparatively few, probably not one person out of ten ever enters a place of worship. The public-house rules supreme, with beer and gin for its inflexible hierophants. No wonder that drunkenness, licentiousness, and crime abound in all directions; no wonder that the reeking streets are filled with lost and miserable women, or that the narrow courts should form so many nests for thieves." Here, indeed and of a truth, Satan seems to have his seat, and to reign comparatively undisturbed, keeping his goods in peace. The Sabbath is regarded as a day of pleasure, idleness, or business. The falsest notions of God, religion, and a future state prevail; consequently, misery abounds, sin is practised, and vice is rampant everywhere. In the very centre of this ocean of depravity and wretchedness, the Christian Mission has its head quarters, and to win these multitudes from the gin palace, the theatre, the concert hall, and the infidel lecture-room, to Christ and usefulness and heaven, is its special work.

But in other cities and towns of this highly favoured country there are districts as destitute as those we have described, though of far more limited extent. To some of these the Lord has so plainly opened our way, and so urgently called us forth, that we dare not resist. Nevertheless, we feel as deeply as ever that the East of London demands our fast and strongest sympathies, and our most strenuous efforts.

## OUR MEASURES.

The means adopted by the Mission are various. Indeed, we gladly employ whatever plans are owned of God in the experience of other labourers in the vineyard, or which appear likely to accomplish the object we have in view. Our purpose is to save some, and to this end we lay hold of them any way we can, "pulling them out of the fire." While we firmly maintain that all the good that is done in the earth, it is the Lord that doeth it, and that the salvation of a soul is of the Lord, and of Him only, nevertheless, it is evident from His word and providence that He works by means, and that He makes success in spiritual labour, as in all other, to depend on the employment of appropriate measures, — that those who, in dependence on the Holy Spirit, work lawfully and wisely, succeed. Consequently, from the beginning we have striven to seek out from God's word, and from the history of God's people, and from the teaching of the Holy Spirit, and from the very circumstances in which we have been placed, methods and instructions for carrying forwards successfully the special work in which we have been engaged.

From this it must not be concluded that our plans are new; looked at carefully they will be found to be mostly as old as the Acts of the Apostles. Amongst them first and foremost stands

## THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL.

To this we attach the greatest importance, and on it we place our chief reliance. While we highly esteem und regularly employ all accessory agencies; nevertheless we place this first in the van, believing, with Paul, that by the foolishness of preaching God has chosen to save them that believe. But how are they to be benefited by preaching when, as we stated at the outset, the great bulk of the people cannot be persuaded to set foot inside church, chapel, or preaching place of any kind? They cannot be saved by a gospel that they do not hear. Feeling this, we go to them. Consequently, one of our principal spheres of labour is

## THE OPEN AIR.

We believe that God has given us a mission to the throngs in the great thoroughfares roaming about on the Sabbath day, and on all other days, thoroughly unconcerned about death, judgment, and eternity. It was these which He first laid on our hearts. To these we believe He has sent us with the glad tidings of great joy, and it is only in this way that we can reach them. Our experience tells us that, although their aversion to churches and chapels is as strong as can well be conceived, they will, nevertheless, eagerly listen to any speaker who, with ordinary ability, in a loving and earnest manner, will set before them the truths of the Bible in the open air. At any hour of the day, or almost any hour of the day, a congregation can be obtained in the great thoroughfares of London. And this is true, not only of the long light summer nights, but of the darkest and most dreary evenings of the winter. Hence we continue our open-air work all the year round. Our instructions to our helpers are, that while the people will stand to listen, they are not only to be willing but thankful for the privilege of proclaiming the story of the cross. With a bitter east wind sweeping down the Whitechapel Road, drifting the snow lying thick around us we have ere now sought a sheltered corner, and found that a crowd would stand to listen for half an hour. Nay, in nothing short of a good down-pour of rain have we failed to gain a congregation. True, when the ground is ankle-deep in mud, it would be unwise to keep the people standing long. But even then, or with a drizzling rain, we sing a verse or two, gather a crowd, interest them with a few words, and then announce the meeting that is to follow indoors, where they can be warmly and comfortably seated to hear more about the same important subject, enticing them to follow us with a lively hymn, as we wove along to the place of meeting. One of our workers in Bethnal Green thus describes their method of

## MISSIONING THE STREETS.

> As we go singing down the street, you may see the doors fly open, and the windows shoot up, and soon we have crowds of eyes and ears upon us from all sides. Every now and then we make a pause, sing a verse or two, and then give a short address, publishing the glorious gospel, and then we fall on our knees, and offer a few short, earnest prayers; then up and on to another corner and there to a fresh crowd tell the old, old story of the cross. By this method we preach Christ to hundreds who would never go so many yards to church, chapel, or an open-air service. This seems to us to be one way of taking the gospel to the people.

## SINGING.

In these open-air operations, singing occupies a very prominent place, and is employed very freely. This always ensures us a congregation. If the speaking fails to draw a crowd, or, as is sometimes the case fails to keep it when gathered, one of our hymns, full of gospel sentiment, sung to a lively stirring tune, fails not speedily to draw another. By this course we have no doubt that gospel truths have been sung into the hearts of tens of thousands who would never have heard them in any other way: and the record of the last day alone will reveal the number of those who have not only been thus attracted to hear the gospel, but have been by this means led to salvation through faith in the Saviour.

True, this kind of work brings with it the result of which the Master spoke. It insures opposition and persecution; it rouses the hatred of men and devils. If you will stop quietly in your church or chapel or, meeting-place, you may talk religion for ever, and beyond a little passing ridicule, the ungodly will let you alone. But go out to them, spread your gospel feast by the highway side, proclaim the truth at the gates of the city, or in the crowded market place, and they will gnash upon you with their teeth, and hate you as they hated Him who went about all the cities and villages of Palestine, preaching the gospel of the kingdom.

We cannot describe the kind of opposition we suffer better than by giving a few extracts from the journals of some of our workers.

## A PUBLICAN AND THE POLICE.

So soon as our brethren commenced the open-air service, a policeman came and ordered them away, saying he would take them to the station if they did not desist. Brother R said he should deem it an honour to be locked up for his Master, whereupon the policeman took them off. By this time a great crowd had gathered, and as they went along they sang —

"I will sing for Jesus,
With His blood He bought me;"

and then

"Jesus, the name high over all,
In hell, or earth, or sky."

At the station they gave tracts to each of the policemen, who were just going on their beat. They then commenced reading the Bible, but being told to sit down, they knelt down and prayed aloud. They were afterward dismissed with an intimation that they would be summoned, and on Saturday the 20th, they appeared before the magistrate. A publican and others, with a lawyer at their head, appeared against them. Robert Baxter, Esq., kindly came forwards for the defence. The policeman complained that an obstruction of the thoroughfare, whereas, there were but some two dozen people when they were first interrupted. The publican complained that the preaching was a nuisance, that the singing, prayer, &c., disturbed the quiet of his customers, would not let his children sleep, nor him and his wife read. He ought to have said it troubled his conscience, for he once told us himself that he had been a Sabbath-school teacher, and that he hated drunkenness as much as we did; but what could he do when he had so much money invested in this business? However, the magistrate took no notice of his complaint on this occasion, but simply said he was sorry for the police to come in collision with the open-air preachers; that there had been an obstruction, that the young men had shown too much zeal, and they must be bound over in their own recognisances not to repeat the same offence in that particular locality for six months.

The three following extracts are from the journal of a brother then labouring at Shoreditch: —

## GETTING A CONGREGATION.

Last week, having taken our stand close to the Eastern Counties Railway Station, a young man came along and interrupted us. One of our brethren kindly remonstrated with him, and told him that if he did not leave his evil ways he would surely be lost, at which he threatened to knock the brother down. I went to him and said, that if there was to be any knocking down, it must be done in the ring where the people could see him; but we would first pray about it, and then he could knock us down as much as he pleased; but before I could get upon my knees he sneaked off through the crowd.

He had scarcely left us, when a drunken man came, and with curses threatened to break up our meeting. I took hold of him, and drawing him to the centre of the people, said, "Let us pray," and falling upon my knees, I called upon God to have mercy on the poor drunkard; but his companions came and drugged him away. When I arose, instead of the small congregation with which we had commenced, there was a large concourse of people, to whom we unfurled the blood-stained banner of the cross; and God was with us.

## AN EAST END OPEN-AIR MEETING.

The Fountain, Commercial Street. Singing attracted a crowd of people. Knelt down and prayed. Sang again. While singing, a very respectable man under the influence of drink, came up with his wife. As soon as she heard it was a hymn we were singing, she wanted to go away; but the husband was so interested that he would not go, and began helping to sing. His wife tried to drag him off, but he would not move. I spoke Jesus, and invited every sinner to come to him and be saved. The man wept and said, "It is all true, sir; I know it is true."

Brother H — next addressed the meeting, and the people were riveted.

Then a man came up, riding upon a horse, and swearing he would ride over us; but as the people dud not move, he could not carry out his intention, and had to pull up, turn round, and ride away. The power of the Spirit was resting upon the people.

Then a half-drunken Irishman came from the public-house close by, with the blood running down his face, having been fighting, or something of the kind. He came raving, and, pushing his way through the crowd, cried out, that he would speak; but the Spirit of God took hold of him, and he said to us, "That's right enough, old fellow;" and listened until the meeting was over. Then we knelt down and prayed, and the Irishman falling on his knees also, and with the clotted blood on his face, said to me, "I am such an awful sinner; can God save me?" O, that it may be the means of the conversion of these two men. They both accompanied us to the meeting in the hall.

## A NEW WAY OF STOPPING THE MOUTHS OF LIONS.

Another evening we were at the same spot, and soon after we commenced the meeting two men came up swearing at us, and sneeringly said, that it was a very well to spout; but that real religion was to help the poor, and give them something to eat. One of them I saw was a regular loafer, so I told him, that when in the past he had been able to help himself, he had helped the publican, and now he had to suffer for it, and that if I did give him anything he would take it to the public-house. The other one here put in and said, "All that's true, sir; but I have a wife and family all starving at home for bread, and if you could help me I should be so thankful." I then turned round and sent a brother for a quartern loaf, and when he brought it, I told him to stand by me with it under his arm, while I went on with the meeting, telling how Jesus could save beggars and paupers, the tears meanwhile running down the poor man's face. I then gave the poor fellow the loaf; but taking him by the hand, I said, "Let us all pray that God may bless the food to this poor man's body and save his soul." The people wept; a great congregation had gathered; and the man, very thankful, went home with the loaf. He washed himself. And came to the Mission Hall, where he knelt and cried to God to have mercy on his soul; and I trust his conversion will be the result.

## OPPOSITION AT POPLAR.

Like men who have to remove mountains, we continue boring and blasting, and are cheered by seeing continually, hearts of stone moved and broken. The word of God is our armoury, the sword of the Spirit our weapon, and "Poplar for Christ" our motto. By the wayside and in the theatre, we sow seed, and in the hall we gather fruit. Opposition continues to do its worst. We have to listen to the vilest oaths, and, at times, calmly bear a few blows. On Saturday evenings the arch fiend rages most ferociously. The fact that they hate and curse us is of small moment, in contrast to the painful truth that many of them have passed through Sabbath-schools, and intellectually know the way of salvation. Such are the most profane; and invariably possess a double portion of the spirit of Satan. When we find it impossible to continue the meeting out-doors, we join rank, and in a singing procession march to the hall.

A week ago we were beset by a gang of six or eight mechanics, emptied from a public-house, but God restrained their violence. Several of them accompanied us to the temperance meeting, signed the pledge, and are now sober men. Amid all this opposition, God keeps us strangers to fear. And while rough hands are upon us, we experience our deepest yearnings for the conversion of men. God so often interposes for us, that we are always persuaded the victory will be on Israel's side. Though often prevented by the cries and yells of wicked men making ourselves heard by the people, a calm endurance for truth's sake creates conviction in many minds, and begets sympathy with the work.

## POLICE OPPOSITION AT STRATFORD.

Evening open-air service. A lot of drunken Catholics going home from a funeral caused a great disturbance. The police ordered our people away; but we told them to remove those who were making the noise, as no one complained but the Catholics, and they did not reside in the neighbourhood. At that, one of the police attacked Brother L— in so rough a manner, that he could not go to work the following day.

On the Monday, I went with him to the station to report the policeman for exceeding his duty. I told the inspector that we did not pay the police to insult us when endeavouring to do good; and that unless the policeman came to my house and made an ample apology for exceeding his duty, I should report him at Scotland Yard. Afterwards, he came, and in the presence of Brother L— said, that he was very sorry he had so far exceeded his duty, and that if we would forgive him, he would never interfere again, but would protect us as far as possible. We gladly forgave him, and may God forgive him too.

## THE WHITECHAPEL ROUGHS.

At Whitechapel, the sons of Belial, who have roared and raved against us for many months, have been in a measure silenced. They had grown so insolent and daring in their opposition, that the other night, when Brother H— was speaking, the crowd interfered, and drove them from the ground. One or two were severely handled.

Exception is now taken to the processioning from the open-air ground to the theatre, and on Friday, the 17th, Brother L— was

## SUMMONED TO WORSHIP STREET POLICE COURT,

for obstructing the foot way. A solicitor had been engaged, and a petition got up and signed by several parties against the preaching. Many things were alleged against us that were untrue. Robert Baxter, Esq., defended the case, as on a former occasion, in the most kindly, dignified, and Christian manner. One of the two witnesses brought up by our enemies said, as soon as he got into the witness-box, that he had nothing to say against the preachers; it was a wicked man who came there uttering all kinds of blasphemy that he wanted to put down. They brought him, as Balak brought Balaam, to curse us, and he blessed us.

The defence was, that for four years we had acted in the manner now complained of, without any objection ever being urged; that the police had not even requested us to leave the footpath, and that we could not be responsible for the wicked proceedings around us; that all these blasphemers would be there if the open-air preachers were not; that we were most anxious to act in concert with the police, and that if they would only communicate their wishes to us, we would comply with them as far as we conscientiously could.

The magistrate was most impartial, and stated, that though he considered an obstruction had been proved, yet, seeing the police had not requested Brother L— to leave the footpath, and there was a desire to conform to the law, he dismissed the summons. All the opposition to the preaching, therefore, fell to the ground. May God forgive those who moved against this effort.

Take the following from the journals of another brother.

## PREACHING IN THE STREETS OF CROYDON.

Saturday, 15th. — Large congregation in the open air, and the devil raged sorely. Several Irish Roman Catholics tried to upset the meeting, but the word of God, which is sharper than any two-edged sword, put them to flight. Then these sons of Belial threw at us, from behind some low houses, a heavy old saucepan, but our heavenly Father guided it, so that it fell just outside our circle.

Sunday, 16th. — Missioned the streets morning, afternoon, and evening. In the afternoon, while some of the converts were speaking, they were beset by a number of mockers who got,

## A WHITEWASH BRUSH,

full of whitening, and daubed it over their black coats, but the grace of God kept them from resenting this treatment in any other way than by falling on their knees and praying for the conversion of their persecutors. This so affected a young man who stood by laughing heartily at what he deemed a good joke, that it led him to think about his soul, saying to himself, "Surely there must be something about this people more than common." At night he came again to the open-air service and followed us into the hall.

26th. — An Irishman raved for a long time, inquiring at the top of his voice, who ordained me to preach. He was the means of getting us a large congregation; that accomplished, the policeman came and took him away, and then came back and moved me off the pavement. The Lord have mercy on him and on his mad countryman. However, their opposition does not stop the Lord saving souls. Hallelujah!

27th. — Open-air service. Freezing very sharp. It astonishes the people to see us out of doors every night, wet or dry, freezing or what else, telling of the love of our dear Saviour. However, I love the work, and I am sure it is doing a great deal of good. The sinners get wounded in the street, and He who wounds outside, heals in the hall. Praised be His holy name.

Feb. 1st. — Open-air service. Very wet and cold night. Still a great many people, and they were very attentive. One mocker kept on crying out, "Chain him up," while I was speaking. But pointing at him with the Word of God in my mouth, he soon retired. A young woman followed us weeping to the hall, when, after the service, she, with two others sought the Saviour.

## PERSECUTION BY THE POLICE

19th. — A mob gathered round, yelling and shrieking. To get away from them we sang up the street, when the opposition increased. At this juncture, down came the police, who, instead of taking off one of the ringleaders in the opposition, laid hands on one of our brethren and haled him to prison. Our friends bailed him out, and on the following morning he was fined 15s. for joining in preaching the Gospel and singing the praises of God in the streets of Croydon. We know what was said about creating obstruction, but it was proved that there was no obstruction, and as to the disturbance, those who made it ought to have been punished. However, we believe the hearts of our Croydon friends are brave to go forward, and even to suffer imprisonment and death, rather than cease to proclaim the blessed Gospel of the Son of God.

Another brother thus describes

## A FLOUR STORM AT BOW COMMON.

On Friday, March 18, we were singing from our open-air stand to the hall, when a man came out of a public-house with a chair for us to preach upon; we at once accepted his offer and commenced preaching, and though hell raged we got the victory. We had the largest congregation we have had in the open-air since I have been here, but we had not been singing long before a storm began to rage, and flour in paper bags came from all quarters. When the bags burst, the flour flew all over us, till we were like millers. But in all this we felt Jesus' presence, and could sing, "I feel like singing all the time." Our enemies, not satisfied with the above, pelted us with mud and stones, and several other things, but victory was proclaimed on Israel's side, and one young man that had not been in the habit of attending a place of worship for more than eight years, followed us to the hall and gave his heart to God. He is working with a neighbouring church, and when speaking his experience, he says, he shall have to bless God for ever that he was in a flour storm on Bow Common.

The next evening, opposition raged as it had done the night before: flour, mud, stones, and cabbage stalks were hurled at us from all points, but our friends were true to their colours, and all rejoiced to be counted worthy to suffer for the gospel's sake.

We close these extracts with the following incident, which occurred at Harrogate, when two of our brethren were assisting at some special meetings, occasioned by the opening of a mission hall, built by a dear friend in connection with his own residence.

## ENCOUNTER WITH WILD BEASTS AT HARROGATE.

On Monday, October 17, we went out for the evening service on the Stray. During the day, Sanger's circus company had fixed themselves up close to our usual stand, and they were now just commencing their evening performance. Not withstanding this, our duty seemed clear to go on with our work, and accordingly we began the service by giving out the hymn, "I'm a pilgrim, bound for glory." While singing this hymn, some of the people employed in the circus began pelting us with clods of mud and tufts of grass. Failing to drive us away by these means, they brought out their brass band, with which they made the most hideous discord, but finding that we were brass-band-proof they moved back to their tent. The next scheme was to send out a large bass and side drum, and forcing their way into our midst, they stood drumming away in front of the speaker, whilst behind him stood a man who clashed in his ears a pair of cymbals; but, praise God! We were able to stand against drums and cymbals.

They then brought out a large elephant and two dromedaries, which they led up and down among the people, occasionally pinching the elephant, or in some way making him coil his trunk high in the air, open his mouth, and make the most alarming shrieks. This greatly increased the excitement already existing among the hundreds of people present. The roughs shouted, women and children shrieked, and every moment we expected some dreadful accident to occur. But God graciously kept us calm and self-possessed. Every time the elephant turned his bulky body round, he sent our little band flying in all directions, so that we were soon divided into groups; but we kept on preaching. Brother W— was hard on in one part, myself in another. Some of the dear sisters laid hold of the coats of the circus people and preached to them, while John Hambleton, with his umbrella high above his head, to keep off the mud and other missiles which were flying about in all directions, was thundering forth the judgments of God against these blasphemers and persecutors.

The police now came and ordered them to take the beasts away, which they reluctantly did, but renewed the annoyance with the drums and cymbals, and collected together hundreds of roughs with tins and kettles. At this juncture, a man in the crowd, sympathising with us, commenced helping them to thump the drum; in a little while, finding it sound very flat and dead, they discovered the man had been striking it with his penknife; and so the drummer with his friends were only too glad to beat a hasty retreat, leaving us in full possession of the field, on which we gave out "Praise God, from whom all blessings flow," which was sung most heartily. We then formed in procession, singing to the hall, and numbers followed, where a useful meeting was held. The persecution lasted just an hour and a half; but God was with us. The victory was ours; and we believe much good was done.

Such is the school in which most of our workers are trained. But while, however, they find it true as it ever was, that he which is born after the flesh persecuteth him that is born after the Spirit, they are often gladdened by the transformation of persecuting souls, and the gathering to their ranks of those who, but for such measures, would never have heard of the glorious gospel of the Son of God. While many instances of conversions, brought about by the open-air services, will be found scattered throughout this report, we give several here which we are sure will be read with interest: —

## A PERSECUTOR CAUGHT.

In the year 1867, a young girl, loosely attired, and with language and habits equally loose, might be seen as the foremost amongst a group of girls similar to herself, striving to annoy those "devil dodgers and ranters," as she termed our brethren and sisters, who daily proclaim the gospel on the Mile End Waste. One evening, while Sister C— was addressing the crowd, this girl, generally known among her companions as the "little un," attempted to interrupt, by saying, "You're all sinners, and going to hell;" they meanwhile urging her on by such sentences as — "Go it, little un," "Now give'em a good un."

When our sister had concluded, Br. K— gave out the hymn —

"We are travelling home to heaven above; Will you go?"

Suddenly a change came over her, and silence was the only answer to the taunts of her companions, and as our friends sang the last verse —

"Oh, could I hear some sinner say, I will go;
I'll start this moment — clear the way, Let me go!"

She exclaimed, "At any rate, I will see where them devil dodgers be going to," and followed the procession to the Mission Hall.

What follows is in the girl's own words: — 

> "I came next evening — the text taken was, 'the wicked shall be turned into hell,' — and went away more wretched still. On the following day, I was sitting in my room, singing and thinking over a hymn I had heard at the Hall —
> 
> 'Hast thou just begun to pray? — Never give up!' —
> 
> when I said, 'Well, them people seems happy; if there's anything to be had I'll have it.' I began to pray, and ask God to change my heart. I believed Jesus, and instantly felt, oh, so happy. I spent the whole day in singing and prayer. My sister and some of the neighbours came and rattled a tea tray down the stairs, sang songs, and tried to knock me over; but this only drove me closer to Jesus, and He helped me through. Oh, I was happy then."

Soon after, her father turned her out of doors for attending a prayer meeting. Finding shelter for the night, she passed two days without daring to go home, and without tasting a morsel of food. She has since told us that she felt so full of the love of Jesus, that she did not want anything to eat. From this time, she endured weeks and months of persecution without wavering. Formerly in the front rank for Satan, she now showed her colours bravely for King Jesus.

But another trial awaited her. Her father, from whom she had suffered much, had become somewhat reconciled, when she feared losing her eye-sight. Well do I recollect the look of resignation, as she brought her tracts one evening, and asked me to find a substitute for a few weeks, as she was compelled to go into the hospital.

We prayed with and for her; but she was so happy and resigned to this increased affliction, that it seemed scarcely needed. After weeks of partial and eight days of entire blindness, the Lord unexpectedly answered our prayers by restoring her sight, and she quickly resumed her place amongst us.

Although some time has passed away since then, she is with us still, walking lovingly and usefully. Her faith has been tried by the deepest poverty and the most bitter persecution, but she has found that He, who brought her out of the horrible pit, and "set her feet upon the rock," is able to make her stand.

The following letter describes

## A MIRACLE OF GRACE.

> Dear Sir, — I have reason to bless the hour that God put the thought into your head to open the Mission at the East End of London, for it has been the means of making me and my family happy in the love of Christ: it has turned me from a drunkard, blasphemer, and liar, to a true believing Christian.
> 
> At the age of thirteen, I went as pot-boy, and remained so until I was sixteen. Here I got the flavour of drink, and I never lost it until I was converted to God, through the blessed words of Bro. L— and Bro. W— spoken in the open-air. When I look back and think how I have beaten my poor wife — it was through the drink — it makes me ashamed of myself. It was the word and the blow, but sometimes the blow first. After I got sober, sometimes it would make me ashamed to look at her black eyes; but I do thank God there is no fear of black eyes now; for we are very happy together.
> 
> I wonder I have never had an explosion, for I have been drunk for a week at a time. I am a stoker and engine driver. On one occasion, I had been drunk overnight, and not very sober in the morning, — I went to work at half-past five, instead of five, and, without looking to see if there was any water in the boiler, I began stoking the fire up. In twenty minutes' time the boiler was red hot. The water had gone from one boiler to the other, through me leaving a tap open that I should have shut. Had I started the engine with the pipe on, the boiler must have burst. It was a very large boiler, in the centre of about sixty houses. But the fright sobered me. There were about forty men at work there. It cost above £100 before it went to work again. But that did not alter me, only for the worse; for I went home, and broke up all my home. I got worse, after that, for I cared for nothing. Half my wages went for drink, and my wife was afraid to speak to me, and the poor children would get anywhere out of my way. Afterwards I was discharged; but I soon got another job; but I could not leave off the drink. I was reckoned a regular "lushington." I lost place after place, and was out of work several weeks at a time; for they did not care to employ a drunkard. Still I would have beer somehow, I did not care how, so that I did get it. I have given one and sixpence for the loan of a shilling, and though there was not a bit of bread at home, the shilling would go for beer.

> I have often had the police called in for ill-using my wife. On one occasion she ran down to her mother's, with her face bleeding, but I went to bed. When I woke, I saw my wife was not there, so I went out and got drunk. I came home, and got a large carving-knife, put it up my sleeve, went down to her mother's, with the intention of killing her; but they saw the knife. The police were called in, and I was taken to Spitalfields station; but no one coming to press the charge, I got off.

> For some months before I was converted I could not sleep at night unless I was drunk; very seldom going to bed without cursing and swearing until I went to sleep, and woke up the same in the morning — waking everybody in the house with my cursing and swearing sometimes in the middle of the night.

> Eight years ago God thought fit to lay me on a bed of sickness for thirteen weeks, and I was given up by all the doctors. When I got better, people thought I would alter my life, and become a steady man; but no, I was as bad as ever. While I was at work, another time, drunk, I lost one of my eyes by an accident; but that did not make me a sober man, nor make me leave off swearing and cursing. I was, in general, drunk two or three times on Sundays. The Sunday that I was convinced I was a sinner I had been drunk twice.

> I did not think there was so much happiness for me; but I do thank God for what he has done for me. He has changed my heart, He has filled me full of the love of Christ; my greatest desire is to tell sinners what a dear Saviour I have found, and to tell them how I found Him.

As companion to the above we insert the following letter from: —

## THE DRUNKARD'S WIFE.

> Dear Sir, — It was a happy day for me and my children when my dear husband was converted to God through Brothers L— and W— preaching at the corner of Sclater Street. Seven months ago, on a certain Sunday, he was standing at the door, when the singing attracted him. He went to listen, when a brother came and spoke to him, and induced him to go with them to the Apollo Music Hall, where he was convinced the Saviour died for sinners, asked for mercy, and obtained it through the blood of the Lamb. He has been the means of me seeking the Saviour, and finding mercy, — also two of his brothers and a sister; and we hope, through the help of God, to be the humble means of bringing many more sinners to know and love the blessed name of the Saviour; for it is a happy life to love and to serve God. We have five young children to bring up: may the Lord help us to bring them up in the way of religion. I have been a wife sixteen years, and never knew happiness till my dear husband was converted.
> 
> Long may this glorious Mission prosper, is the earnest prayer of A CONVERTED DRUNKARD'S WIFE.

The following is the testimony of a man about fifty years of age, given nearly two years ago. He is still with us, happy as ever, and steadfast in the faith: —

## A DOG FANCIER AND PIGEON FLYER

I have been a dog fancier and a pigeon flyer, but, through all, felt there was something more I needed which I did not get either by the pigeons or the dogs. On Sunday last, I was coming down Club Row with my boy, to buy two bird cages, when my attention was taken by the out-door preaching. I stayed and listened, and was much affected. I turned to my little boy, and said, "That is very good, isn't it?" and he answered, "Yes, it is, father." I was invited to the meeting, and, in the evening, I went. The truth laid hold of me, and I gave my heart to Jesus, and I have never been so happy before. I awoke this morning feeling so light; the burden had gone off my heart.

## A WANDERING PRODIGAL CAUGHT BY SINGING.

One Sunday evening, an Irishman was passing down the Mile End Road. He had long been a wanderer on the face of the earth, and for many a year had lived a life of drunkenness, debauchery, and almost every kind of sin. He had just returned from Canada, and in the few days that had elapsed since landing, he had spent some £20 in riot and dissipation. On this particular evening he was far from being in a very happy mood, when he met us singing, —

"We are bound for the land of the pure and the holy,
The home of the happy, the kingdom of love;
Ye wanderers from God in the broad road of folly,
O say, will you go to the Eden above?"

He said to himself, "Sure, that is the very place where I would like to go." He followed us to a dancing room, and was deeply convicted. The following Sabbath he came again, and was retiring, when we met him at the door, and urged him at once to fly to Christ; he returned with us up the room, and sought and found Jesus. He has since walked with God, though, for a long time he had to work among many hundreds of men of the most debased character. In the midst and in the face of much persecution he was enabled to witness a good confession, and he is now a very useful helper in the mission.

Doubtless much good is done in the open air, of which we never hear a word. In one of his reports, the brother stationed at Limehouse thus speak of

## BREAD CAST UPON THE WATERS.

After I had done speaking in the open air the other evening, a man came up, and taking me by the hand, said, "I thank God I ever heard you speak in the Mile End Road. While I stood and heard you there, I was convinced I was a sinner on the way to hell. I was so much affected that I could scarcely stand. I went home, shut myself up in my room, fell down on my knees for the first time in my life, and with tears running down my cheeks, cried out, 'Lord, save me.' I obtained mercy, joined the Methodist society, and have ever since been travelling with rejoicing in the way to heaven."

"The other week," he went on to say, "my father came to see me, from the country. I tried hard to get him to either church or chapel, but could not; so I brought him to the Gaff, where he was awakened, and he has gone home very miserable. O may he speedily find Jesus."

It will be seen from the foregoing incidents that the great usefulness of our open-air services consists in drawing the people to the preaching indoors, where, quietly seated, free from the distraction caused by the dissipating sights and sounds never absent in the streets of a town or city, the gospel can with greater clearness be set forth and apprehended; more pressing appeals can be made in favour of an immediate closing with Christ; earnest prayer can be offered, and an opportunity secured for personal conversation with the people. And in audition to this going out into the streets and lanes of the city with the free offer of the gospel, we have endeavoured still further to gain the ear of the people by

## PREACHING IN THEATERS, HALLS, CONCERT ROOMS,

or places prominently situated. We strive to go where the crowd is. The devil and his followers act on this principle. They seek out the most public thoroughfares, and there push forward their soul-ruining business; and by so doing they succeed. We have been enabled to do this also to a limited extent, and have thereby won hundreds to the cross, whose faces we should never have seen had we been up some back street unnoticed and unknown. A brief description of the places we have occupied, and still hold will be found further on, and also some account of the blessed results that have ensued.

## HOUSE TO HOUSE VISITATION.

Many of our helpers visit among the people five hours every day, looking after the new converts, hunting up the wanderers from the fold, or

## VISITING THE SICK AND DYING.

As the result of the very public character of our work in the open-air, theatres, and halls, the Mission and those who labour in it are very widely known; hence in sickness, or on the near approach of death, our people are sent for in all directions. A more important work than this cannot well be conceived, and as far as we can judge in such circumstances, many most hopeful cases of conversion have transpired. We give a few extracts from the diaries of two or three of our workers, which to us are precious proofs of the usefulness of this kind of labour.

A sister writes as follows: —

## A LION CHANGED TO A LAMB.

Dear Sir, — A dock-labourer, living in one of the worst localities in the East of London, who was converted in this mission, called and asked me to visit a neighbour who was dying. My husband being unwilling for me to go into such an awful neighbourhood, went himself. When he got there, the man, who was very ill, refused to hear him. My husband, however, continued speaking, and after a while knelt down to pray, on which the man sprang out of bed, and, seizing the poker, with fearful imprecations threatened to take his life, and so drove him from the room.

A fortnight afterwards I was much impressed that I had neglected my duty in not going to see this man myself, and decided to go in the morning. Accordingly I went; and, on entering the chamber, the dying man told me with an oath that he did not want to see or hear me; all he wanted was sleep. In bed with him was his little daughter, a child of about twelve years of age, sick with a fever. Thinking that, perhaps, I might be able to reach the heart of the father through the child, I commenced talking with her about Jesus, and found her totally ignorant of the children's Saviour. I now spoke again to the man, and, finding him a little softened, asked if I should read to him a story about a man who was once in trouble like himself. To this he sulkily consented; on which I read some of the experiences of David when in affliction. So ignorant was the man, he had no idea I was reading from the Bible. I then asked if he would allow me to pray with him, promising not to be long. To this he made no answer, so I knelt down and prayed. As I rose from my knees, to my great joy, I saw that the man was bathed in tears. The Lord had entered and broken his heart. I then told him, to his great surprise, that I had been reading the Bible, and gave him a copy with large print, and talked to him further on the way of salvation. On leaving, he begged me to come again, saying his hatred to God's word and people was all gone.

When I called again, I found him anxious about his soul; but he had not as yet laid hold of Christ. I urged upon him the necessity of being born again, and left him deeply convinced.

At my third visit I was privileged to see him cast himself at the foot of the cross, where he found peace through the blood of a crucified Redeemer. He lived after this about six weeks, during which time I visited him every two or three days. Throughout he was enabled to rejoice in a pardoning Saviour. The last time I called, I found him imploring his family, who had come to see him, to seek Christ. We read and prayed, and had a blessed season together; four appeared anxious. When he bade me farewell, he expressed his full dependence on Christ, and told me that he would meet me in heaven.

A brother relates the following interesting case: —

## MARY DOBSON.

Another redeemed one has gone from the East of London, to join the ever-increasing multitude who have gone out of much tribulation, who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. What a change for Mary Dobson! Only a little time ago, Sister C. found her in the greatest destitution, and the grossest ignorance of God and eternity, in a small room, some eight feet square, and seven feet high. In one corner was an old bed on which she and her husband slept; in another was a bundle of dirty rags on which four children, the eldest a girl of fourteen, and the next a boy of ten, laid their heads; in another corner of this same little room was a shoemaker's scat at which the husband earned their daily bread. They had lived there fifteen years; all the children were born there; but the last three years it could hardly be called living; they had all but starved, the husband's earnings not averaging over seven shillings per week. When our sister first visited them, the mother, far advanced in consumption, was being held on one of the chairs, in an upright position, attempting the task of mending an old pair of trousers. When asked if she had any food, it came out that there were but two slices of bread between the six; and that, as she could not eat bread, she was starving. Her looks only too plainly confirmed the story; and, worn by disease and want of food, she appeared on the very brink of the grave.

Her bodily wants were first ministered to, and she was then urged at once to seek Christ with all her heart, as it was evident she would soon have to leave this world; and before she could enter heaven she must be converted.

"Converted!" she said; "what do you mean? Is that what has been done at Bill C—, my brother-in-law? Something has come to him. He goes to some mission place, and does not get drunk, and beat his wife, and abuse his children, but brings his money home, and he's got a pair of black trousers. Is 'converted' what's been done to our Bill?"

Some twelve months since, this Bill C —, who is a dock-labourer, and who was a lost drunkard, was awakened and saved in the theatre; and in consequence a great change had taken place in his home. Instead of living in a cellar, he had got into a nice little house, and had got some decent clothing for himself and family. This was a wonderful change; and the poor woman's first idea of conversion came through the change which she had seen with her own eyes, in her brother-in-law, Bill C—.

The plan of salvation, through faith in Jesus, was set before her by our sister, who left with her Mr. Gurney's tract on "The Blood," remarking that the blood of Christ, like the waves of the sea, washes away all filth.

"O yes!" she exclaimed, "I see that." After three days earnest seeking, she obtained a blessed sense of sins forgiven, and rejoiced greatly in the liberty of God's dear children. Her peace from that day flowed like a river, and no doubt ever crossed her mind. For one whole week she ate nothing and during two days she did not speak; but on the following day she revived, and told those about her what God had done for her soul. She said, "the first day I tried to pray, but could not; and it was the same on the second day; but on the third I prayed, and the door of mercy flew open, and I entered in; and since then it has been easy work to pray. I pray day and night. "Oh!" she exclaimed, "I see troops upon troops of angels; and Jesus stands in the midst of all, waiting to take me home to heaven."

There were at this time four women in the room. She called them each by name, and, with a death-bed solemnity, urged them to give their hearts to God.

In a lower room of the house lived an old navvy, blackened by iniquity, and as hard as a rock; but what he saw and heard so thoroughly melted him, that he sought mercy and found it. A day or two afterwards, on our calling, he told us what God had done for him. We had the other members of the house together, and prayed in the navvy's room, and found it good to be there.

Three days before the death of our sister, she called her husband, and said, "Bill, sign the pledge, and give your heart to God, and train the children for heaven, and have no companions but Bill C—, for he will point you the way to Jesus. "Oh!" she said, "if I could get out, I would make Burners Street (here her two sisters live) ring with the songs of Zion!"

Just before she died, on seeing someone in the room, she cried in a rapture of joy, "Come and help me sing, come and help me sing!" and the rough voices sang our 327th hymn, that some of them had heard in the theatre: —

"Come, sing to me of heaven,
When I'm about to die;
Sing songs of holy ecstasy,
To waft my soul on high.
Then to my enraptured ear
Let one sweet song be given;
Let Jesus cheer me last on earth,
And greet me first in heaven," &c.

Then, "There is rest for the weary," &c., was sung, and then she exclaimed, "There is rest for me, rest for me!" Then was sung the 13th, "There is a better world, they say," &c.; and on Friday evening, 19th February, 1869, Jesus said, "Come away," and that redeemed spirit took its flight from that wretched abode of poverty and suffering, to stand before the throne of the Lamb, clothed with a white robe, and with a palm in her hand. There shall she "hunger no more, neither thirst any more: for the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed her, and shall lead her unto living fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all tears from her eyes." May we all meet there!

Another sister gives the following incident: —

## THE DYING WIFE AND HER INFIDEL HUSBAND.

Some time ago, I visited a poor woman, far advanced in consumption, and found her a most pitiable object. She had been a very fine woman, but the withering hand of disease had reduced her to a mere skeleton. On conversing with her, I found her o. stranger to God, and quite ignorant of the simple plan of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. I endeavoured to be plain and faithful with her, and left her, promising to come again as soon us possible. I felt she had not long to live, and earnestly prayed that God would reveal Himself to her, and give her peace. I saw her several times after this; but she was apparently unaltered; and I became intensely anxious about her. I knew that every opportunity might be the last; and as I stood by her bedside, day after day, I did not know how to leave her.

One morning I was requested to go and see her much earlier than usual, as she was much worse. I went, and, to my inexpressible delight, found that a wonderful change had been wrought since my last visit. The joy that beamed in her face bespoke the feelings of her heart. She was happy. The Saviour had washed her sins away in his precious blood; "and now," said she, "I am going to be with Jesus." She sang in a sweet, clear voice —

"Soon to Jordan's swelling river,
Like a pilgrim, I shall come;
Then I hope to shout salvation,
And go singing glory home."

It was the will of God, however, that she should suffer longer here; and she lingered two months after this, testifying for Jesus. She suffered acute pain; but I never heard her murmur. Sometimes she would say," Oh, my poor body, how it does suffer! but it is nothing compared with what my blessed Saviour suffered for me;" then she would sing again; and thus she lived till the chariot come to convey her to the realms of everlasting bliss. I stood by her bedside a short time before she passed away. As I entered the room, she was singing — "I love Jesus — Hallelujah!" She was already in the river; the death-film had gathered over her eyes. She grasped my hand, and bade me farewell till we should meet in glory. She went triumphantly to heaven. To God be all the praise! Those that knew her in her life could not help saying she was a miracle of grace. Blessed be His holy name.

## HER INFIDEL HUSBAND.

I had inquired, during her illness, about her husband, and was told that he was a man of infidel principles, and that he would not listen to anything about religion. Still I felt a great desire to see him, as I knew no cases were too bad for my Saviour; and I thought he might be won. I told her I should like to see him; and she begged of him to meet me; but he always got out of the way when I was coming. I was determined, however, to see him; and after waiting one morning for two hours, I had the opportunity so long desired. I felt that no place would be more suitable for conversing with him than the bedside of his lying wife; and I thought I might find a way to his heart by sympathizing with him in his trial. Oh, how I prayed that God would help me. I felt that I needed heavenly wisdom; and God who giveth to all men liberally, gave it to me. As we spoke of the dying one before us, I told him of trials that I had been called to pass through myself, how I had buried loved ones, and how that God's grace had been sufficient for me. He listened and wept. I prayed with him there, and then went home to plead with God for him in my closet.

I did not see him again while his wife was living; but having invited him to the meetings, after his wife's death he became a regular attendant at the Mission Hall and Theatre. Gradually his heart opened to receive the truth; and after a little while, he embraced Jesus as his Saviour, and obtained mercy. He is now one of the happiest Christians I know. I cannot describe his former life better than in his own words.

> "Saved from the gates of hell. From my youth up, I, for forty years, followed the vanities of the world. The devil has done just as he liked with me. I practised everything that was bad — man-fighting, dog-fighting, cock-fighting, horse-racing, gambling, and the evil of all other evils — drunkenness to excess; in fact, I have done everything that the devil could put a man up to do: but God, in His great mercy, opened my eyes, before I dropped into hell. The death of my dear wife was a great trial; but it was a very great blessing; for the seed sown then has been watered. I saw Mrs. C— only once; but I never forgot what she said. I attended the services in connection with the mission; and, encouraged by Mr. Booth's preaching, I went on till I found the Saviour; and now I am happy. I get happier and happier every day. I have given up all for Jesus. I have done with the glass and the pipe. I have washed my hands of it all — Glory be to God! — and, by God's help, I never mean to touch it any more. I have trials and difficulties; but God helps me through them all. My old mates in my workshop lead me a rough life; but I hope to bring them to Jesus. Oh, what cannot God do? Praise His holy name!"

From a sister's journal labouring at Shoreditch, we take the following:

## JUST IN TIME.

I was called to visit a man fast sinking in consumption. He had been a soldier, and fought in the Crimean war, but latterly he had been employed in a brewery. He was one of our bitterest opponents in the open-air. Standing over six feet, and of powerful build, he would lead on the rowdies in all manner of persecution. The first time I called he appeared quite indifferent, but continuing our efforts he was fully awakened, and I believe savingly converted to God. He died singing —

"I on the brink of ruin fell ;
Glory to God, I'm out of hell."

As his feet were in the swellings of Jordan, he exclaimed, "He is coming, He is coming" and then passed away, —another trophy of grace awakened and saved in the eleventh hour.

## EXPERIENCE MEETINGS

Are often mentioned in this Report. A very good idea of the character of these services will be gathered from a paper which appeared in The Revival, from the pen of the Secretary of the Open Air Mission, entitled

## AN AFTERNOON WITH WILLIAM BOOTH.

On the afternoon of Sunday, January 31, I was able to see some of the results of William Booth's work in the East of London, by attending his experience meeting, held in the East London Theatre. About two o'clock some of his helpers and converts went out from the Mission Hall, where they had been praying together, and held an open-air meeting in front of a large brewery opposite the hall. The ground was damp and the wind high, but they secured an audience, and then sang hymns along the road, till they came to the theatre, taking in any who chose to follow them. Probably about 500 were present, though many came in late. The meeting commenced at three, and lasted one hour and a half. During this period forty-three persons gave their experience, parts of eight hymns were sung, and prayer was offered by four persons. After singing Philip Phillips' beautiful hymn, "I will sing for Jesus," by Mr. Booth and two others.

A young man rose, and told of his conversion a year ago last Tuesday, thanking God that he had been kept through the year.

A negro of the name of Burton interested the meeting much by telling of his first open-air service, which he had held during the past week in Ratcliffe Highway, one of the worst places in London. He said, when the people saw him kneel in the gutter, engaged in prayer for them, they thought he was mad.

Hymn, "Christ, He sits on Zion's Hill."

A young man under the right hand gallery having briefly spoken, one of Mr. Booth's helpers, a Yorkshireman, with a strong voice and a hearty manner, told of the open-air meetings, the opposition they encountered, and his determination to go on, in spite of all opposition from men and devils.

A middle-aged man on the right, a sailor, told how he was brought to Christ during his passage home from Columbo. One of the Dublin tracts, entitled "John's Difficulty," was the means of his conversion.

A young man to the right having told how, as a backslider, he had recently been restored, a cabman said he had a deal to talk about. The Lord had pardoned all his sins. He used to be in the public-house constantly, but he thanked God he ever heard William Booth, for it led to his conversion.

Three young men on the right then spoke. The first, who comes five miles to these meetings, told how he was lost through the drink, and restored by the gospel; the second said he was unspeakably happy; and the third said he would go to the stake for Christ.

A middle-aged man in the centre spoke of his many trials. His sight was failing him, that of one eye having gone entirely, but the light of Christ shone brilliantly in his soul.

Hymn, "Let us walk in the light," &c.

A young man described his feelings as he had recently passed the place where he was born; and a sister followed with some reflections on the same subject, and then spoke of her husband's conversion, and how they were both now rejoicing in God.

After a young man on the left had told how his soul had recently revived, another young man on the right testified to the Lord having pardoned his sins in the theatre on the previous Sunday.

Two sailors followed each other. The first spoke of his conversion through reading a tract while on his way to the Indies four months ago. The other said he was going to sea next week, and was going to take some Bibles, hymns, and tracts with him, to see what could be done for Christ on board. He thought the conversion of sailors was fulfilling the passage, "The abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee."

Hymn, "I believe I shall be there, And walk with Him in white."

A young man of the name of John, sometimes called "Young Hallelujah," told of his trials while selling fish in the streets, but he comforted himself by saying, "'Tis better on before." He had been drawn out in prayer at midnight on the previous night, and had dreamed all night that he was in a prayer-meeting. He was followed by another, a converted thief, who told how he was "picked up," as he termed his conversion, and of his persecutions daily while working in a shop with twenty unconverted men.

A man in the centre, who had been a great drunkard, said, "What a miserable wretch I was till the Lord met with me! I used to think I could not do without my pint a day, but the Lord pulled me right bang out of a public-house into a place of worship."

He was followed by a young man who was converted at one of the breakfast meetings last year, and who said he was exceedingly happy. Another young man on the left said how happy he was, and his desire was to speak more and work more for Jesus.

Two sisters then spoke. The first uttered a brief inaudible sentence, and the second told of being so happy every day, and wanting to be more faithful, ending by a short, touching prayer.

Hymn, "Shall we meet beyond the river, Where the surges cease to roll?"

A young woman in the centre said, "I well remember the night I first heard Mr. Booth preach here. I had a heavy load of sin upon my shoulders. But I was invited to come on the stage. I did so, and was pointed to Jesus, and obtained peace."

Another told of his conversion by a tract, four years ago, on his passage out to Sydney. "To my sorrow," he said, "I become a backslider. But I thank God he ever brought me here. That blessed man, Mr. Booth, preached, and I gave my heart to God afresh. I now take tracts to sell regularly. I have only eighteen shillings a week, but I save my tobacco and beer money to buy tracts."

Hymn, "I never shall forget the day."

A sister said, "I gave my heart to God at my mother's death-bed when I was nine years of age. Yesterday I visited a sick woman, who said, 'The tract you gave me, "The blood, the blood," led me to cast my soul on Jesus'" — another instance of the usefulness of tracts.

A stout man, a navvy, who said he had been one of the biggest drunkards in London, having briefly spoken, was followed by one known as "Jemmy the butcher," who keeps a stall in the Whitechapel-road. Some one had cruelly robbed him, but he found consolation by attending the Mission Hall prayer meeting at one o'clock.

Two young lads, recently converted, having given their experience, a dock labourer, converted seventeen months ago, asked the prayers of the meeting for his wife, yet unconverted. Some of his comrades, during the last week, said, "What a difference there is in you now to what there used to be."

Three young women followed each other. The first spoke but a sentence or two, and her voice was inaudible. The desire of the second was to live more to Christ. The third had a singularly clear voice, and distinct utterance, and gave her experience very intelligently. It was a year and a half since she gave her heart to the Saviour, but her husband does not yet see with her. Her desire was to possess holiness of heart, and to know more of the language of Canaan.

The experience of an old man, who next spoke, was striking. Mr. Booth had announced his intention, some time back, of peaching a sermon on "The Derby," at the time of those races. This man was attracted by curiosity, and when listening compared himself to a broken-down horse. This sermon was the means of his conversion. The greatest wonder to his companions is that he won't drink. He loses a shilling every time he attends the week-night meetings.

Hymn, "Can you tell me what ship is going to sail?"

Two sisters then spoke. The first had been very much cast down for seven or eight weeks, but she comforted herself by saying, "'Tis better on before," though at present her cross was great. The second said it was two years since she found peace, and she was very happy.

A young man to the left told how his sins were taken away. He worked in the city, and someone took him to hear the Rev. E.P. Hammond, in John Street Chapel. He did not find peace then, but afterwards, as a young man was talking to him in the street, near the Post Office, he was able to see the way of salvation, and rejoice in it. He used to fall asleep generally under the preaching. "But here," he said, "under Mr. Booth, I can't sleep."

A little boy, one of Mr. Booth's sons, gave a simple and good testimony. He was followed by a young man to the right, and then an interesting blind girl, whom I had noticed singing heartily in the street, told of her conversion last August.

A girl under the gallery told how she found peace seventeen months ago; and then Mr. Booth offered a few concluding observations and prayed. The meeting closed by singing,

"I will not be discouraged,
For Jesus is my friend."

Such is a brief outline of this most interesting meeting, held Sunday after Sunday. But it is impossible to describe it so as to convey any adequate impression to the reader's mind. Mr. Booth led the singing by commencing the hymns without even giving them out. But the moment he began, the bulk of the people joined heartily in them. Only one or two verses of each hymn were sung as a rule. Most of them are found in his own admirably compiled hymn-book.

I could not but wonder at the change which had come over the people. The majority of those present, probably nearly 500, owed their conversion to the preaching of Mr. Booth and his helpers. How would they have been spending Sunday afternoon, if this blessed agency had not been set on foot?

In the evening I preached in the Oriental Music Hall, High-street, Poplar, where 500 or 600 persons were assembled. This is one of the more recent branches of Mr. Booth's work, and appears to be in a very prosperous condition. I found two groups of the helpers singing and preaching in the streets, who were only driven in by the rain just before the meeting commenced inside. This is how the people are laid hold of.

Shall this good work be hindered for the want of a few hundred pounds? This is the question for Christians to pray over, think about, and answer.

Gawin Kirkham.

**Historical Context:** This chapter documents the origins and methods of William Booth's Christian Mission (later The Salvation Army) in London's East End during the late 1860s. Beginning with tent meetings in Whitechapel, the Mission developed innovative evangelistic approaches including open-air preaching, street singing, and theatrical venues to reach the urban poor who avoided traditional churches. The detailed accounts of opposition from publicans, police harassment, and physical persecution illustrate the controversial nature of their work, while conversion testimonies demonstrate its effectiveness among London's most destitute populations. These methods would become foundational to Salvation Army evangelism worldwide.
