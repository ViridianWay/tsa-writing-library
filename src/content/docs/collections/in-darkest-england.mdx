**Author:** William Booth | **Published:** 1890

William Booth's most influential book exposed the desperate conditions of England's poor and proposed a radical three-part scheme — the City Colony, the Farm Colony, and the Colony Over-Seas — to rescue those trapped in what he called "the submerged tenth" of society. It remains one of the foundational texts of modern social work.
