**Speaker:** General Lyndon Buckingham | **August 2025** | Lake Junaluska, NC

At the 2025 Salvation Army Bible Conference, General Lyndon Buckingham delivered a three-part series on hope rooted in Paul's letter to the Colossians. From the supremacy of Christ, to the mystery of "Christ in you," to the practical call to live as influencers for the Kingdom — these sermons challenged Salvationists to commit to "the second half" of the Army's mission with renewed fire and purpose.
