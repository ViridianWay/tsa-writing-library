**Author:** Frank Duracher | **Published:** 2019

Inspired by Paul Harvey's famous "The Rest of the Story" segments, Frank Duracher compiled over 50 stories from the frontlines of The Salvation Army around the world. These true stories — some well known, some forgotten, some never before told — are drawn from contemporary ministry, Army history, Christmas traditions, disaster relief work, and Scripture itself. Originally published across multiple Salvation Army periodicals over 20 years, they are gathered here as a testament to the remarkable people and moments woven into the fabric of The Salvation Army.
