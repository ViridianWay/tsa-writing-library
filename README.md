# The Salvation Army Writing Collection

This project is a growing digital archive of historical writings, publications, and reflections from The Salvation Army—curated to inspire spiritual depth, historical understanding, and faithful daily use.

The goal is to create a trusted, beautiful, and searchable home for Salvation Army texts—starting with public domain and foundational works, with careful formatting and contextual metadata to support devotion, study, and teaching.

## 🤲 Spirit of the Project

This is an unofficial work of spiritual stewardship.

While the content within these writings belongs to the public domain or The Salvation Army as a movement, the design, formatting, and curation of this collection were created to foster reverence, accessibility, and spiritual engagement. You are encouraged to read, explore, and share by linking to the live site once it's public.

> “Please don’t redistribute or repackage these files elsewhere. Instead, help us honor the original voices by keeping this a central space of reflection and discovery.”

## 🛠️ How It’s Structured

- `Series/` – full books, speeches, or letters, titled by date
- `Quotes/` – (planned) extracted insights from the texts, searchable by theme
- `Commentary/` – (planned) reflections and blog posts on key writings
- All files are written in **Markdown** and structured for static site generation

## 🚧 In Progress

This project is actively being built and refined. The public site is not yet live, but if you'd like to contribute or learn more, please contact the creator.
