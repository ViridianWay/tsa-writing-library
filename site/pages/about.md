# About This Project

This site is a living archive of Salvation Army writings, built to preserve and amplify the voices that have shaped our mission, theology, and spiritual legacy.

It is unofficial, but deeply rooted in the heart of The Salvation Army—to love, to serve, and to disciple. Every document here has been curated, cleaned, and formatted with the intention of honoring the past while making it accessible for the present.

Whether you're a cadet, a corps officer, a soldier, or simply curious—this space was made for you.
