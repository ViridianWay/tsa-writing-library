Over the course of more than 15 years, thousands of children in Union County, Arkansas have been helped by the community’s Spring Feed. Each year during Spring Break for the local school system, The Salvation Army of El Dorado calls on local partners and volunteers to help prepare sandwiches and pack sack lunches for distribution.

“The goal is to help feed children who may not be able to get lunch while away from school,” says Major David Robinson, corps officer. “We want to make sure that no children go hungry at this time each year.”

Meals are delivered within the city of El Dorado and across Union County, including to smaller Arkansas communities such as Norphlet, Smackover, Hutting, and Strong. More than 5,000 sack lunches were distributed in a single week in 2025, thanks in large part to the help of more than 200 volunteers.

“We love our community of El Dorado and the many people who come and give of themselves by volunteering during the week,” Major Robinson says. “We can’t do this alone. We depend on our community, and they never let us down.”
