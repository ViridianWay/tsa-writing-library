Bible Conference has been a consistent and beloved item on the Southern Territorial calendar for over 70 years. Hosted at picturesque Lake Junaluska in North Carolina, families, officers, retired officers, and friends come together for a week of Bible teaching, worship, and fellowship.

“Bible Conference focuses on rest and refreshment in the presence of Jesus,” Lt. Colonel Mark Israel, territorial program secretary, tells us. “It is a week of soaking in the Word and sharing the experience with family and friends. All of those are equal components of the Bible Conference experience. It is an annual time that we as a territory step away from the pressures of our daily living and become available to God for spiritual renewal.”

This year’s theme for the week is “Kingdom Living: Awaken Hope,” the third in a series focusing on the Kingdom of God. Multiple teaching sessions each day will delve into what the Bible says about the hope we have in being a part of God’s Kingdom even in our daily lives.

Every day of the event includes biblical edification brought by fantastic special guest speakers and powerful worship. And this year promises to be extra special.

“We are thrilled General Lyndon and Commissioner Bronwyn Buckingham will be two of our speakers along with Dr. Matt Ayers. Karl and Lauren Westwood, Salvationists from the United Kingdom and Ireland Territory, will be our special music guests,” Lt. Colonel Israel shares.

And Bible Conference is not just for adults seeking biblical enrichment. Roberta Simmons-Smith, territorial director of special events, tells us, “There is life-changing, dynamic, and exciting programming for all ages! Childcare and Youth Conference range from 0-17 years of age. And young adults are in for a real treat this year as they will engage in special programming designed just for them!”

Special programs throughout the week include the Friday Adult Rehabilitation Center night, the Saturday youth musical, and many more dynamic worship moments. “You won’t want to miss the exciting ending to the week on the final Saturday of Bible Conference. The Saturday, August 9 Welcome of Cadets program will celebrate the Proclaimers of Transformation session – which will include music by our very own Staff Band,” Simmons-Smith announces.

Registration for this year’s Bible Conference is now open. For more information and to register, visit southernbibleconference.org.

Registration is now open for Commissioning 2025, set to take place from June 6 through June 8 at the Atlanta Temple Corps.

In addition, the Champions of the Mission session of cadets will be ordained and commissioned during the weekend, with Saturday night’s program including a focus on young adults.
