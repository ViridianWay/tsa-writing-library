After months of prayer, preparation, and planning, the Divisional Band & Creative Arts of the Texas Division made the long trek to the South American country of Bolivia in early February. The visit included a six-day music camp and concluded with a weekend of 30th Anniversary celebrations for the William Booth School in the city of Oruro.

On their first day, a small team of 10 members from Texas were enthusiastically greeted by campers and staff at Campamento Kewiña, about 90 minutes from Cochabamba in Central Bolivia. The theme of the week was “Heirs of the Kingdom,” and the 250 camp delegates worked tirelessly and diligently in their various classes and disciplines. The travel-exhausted Texans were quickly immersed in camp activities and made to feel right at home, despite the challenging 11,000-foot altitude and extremely cold temperatures. The camp was constantly abuzz with worship and classes in brass band, choir, dance, drama, praise band, timbrels, percussion, leadership, and more.

“The energy of the campers fueled us for the week,” says Texas Divisional Music Director Matt Broome. “We were so well-received and revered; so undeserved, like God’s grace. The young people couldn’t get enough of every aspect of the camp, and the officers and volunteers took care of our every need. The family of God was on full display; bonds that won’t be forgotten.”

The remaining 35 group members from Texas arrived on Tuesday in time to present a concert to campers and staff. The Bolivian Salvationists responded enthusiastically and wholeheartedly to the music, presentations, and worship. Captain Aaron Alarcón, program secretary for the Bolivia Division, coordinated the camp and was one of the hosts for the duration of the trip. Quickly becoming fast friends with the Texas group, Captain Alarcón says he felt God working all week, especially during the spiritual meetings. “The bandsmen were always willing to listen to the voice of God in those moments and help our youth through prayer and discussion.” Texas’ visit was Bolivia’s first from a large performing group for many years, and campers and staff openly shared they felt an immense sense of self-worth and blessing through the partnership.

A brief stop to tour The Salvation Army’s Harry Williams Hospital in Cochabamba was followed by a five-hour drive over the Andes mountains, on perhaps the scariest road on the planet! The weekend saw a busy schedule of events including an open-air concert, march, and other ministry opportunities connected to the 30th Anniversary celebrations of the impressive William Booth School in Oruro. More than 1,100 children attend the school located in the center of the city, where the band performed for the students and staff, taught a wide range of music and arts classes on Friday morning, and participated in a march of witness through the city streets alongside school musicians. A public concert took place Friday evening with more than 750 people in attendance.

The Salvation Army is alive and thriving in Bolivia, as exemplified by the passionate and committed Salvationists encountered. The Divisional Band & Creative Arts members, supported by Texas Divisional leaders Lt. Colonels Art and Ann Penhale, were privileged to minister and travel throughout the beautiful country and incredibly blessed by those they encountered, along with the impactful programs and ministries experienced.

“We will never be able to quantify or measure the impact this experience had or will continue to have in Bolivia for its people and here in Texas for our own,” says Lt. Colonel Ann Penhale, who was moved and grateful for her time in Bolivia.

Through generous donations from several Texas corps, the group was able to leave behind 11 instruments and 30 music stands to continue the development of music ministry in Bolivia. We pray for the seeds planted in the lives of men, women, boys, and girls during the trip, that the Lord will use this visit to His glory and to strengthen and encourage The Salvation Army in Bolivia.
