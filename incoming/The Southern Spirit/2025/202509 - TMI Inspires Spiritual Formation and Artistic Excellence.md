For the third consecutive summer, The Salvation Army’s Southern Territorial Music Institute (TMI) took place at Asbury University in Wilmore, Kentucky, with approximately 300 individuals coming together for a week-long gathering of fellowship, music education, and worship. Nick Simmons- Smith, territorial music and creative arts education secretary, announced the adoption of “a new maxim” for TMI this year and moving forward: **Spiritual Formation and Artistic Excellence.**

“Both aspects were on full display at TMI as Majors Nick and Lisa Hanover led us to discover spiritual disciplines and gave us helpful tips and hints to becoming more like Christ,” Simmons-Smith said. Majors Hanover currently serve as officers in the United Kingdom and were responsible for daily “Morning Manna” devotionals. Majors Hanover also joined with other tremendous guests in each artistic discipline. “Howard and Heather Evans (United Kingdom), Heather and Matthew Osmond (Canada), and Vania Claiborne (North Carolina) were excellent guests,” Simmons-Smith said. “They combined artistic excellence with quality communication skills and a vibrant spiritual experience.”

After an opening day of auditions and class placements, the tone was set for the week during TMI’s first full gathering in the late afternoon of Thursday, July 24. Majors Hanover laid out a focus on five spiritual disciplines: **Service, Sabbath, Simplicity, Fasting, and Celebration.** Major Nick Hanover described each as practices and habits embodied by Jesus Christ. “Our hope and prayer this week is that each and every one of us will encounter something this week to inspire us to live and love like Jesus.”

Each day at TMI is filled with classroom instruction in addition to Morning Manna gatherings, recreational activities, and special evening programs. Delegates select a major class to attend twice each day, with TMI simultaneously offering four bands, one percussion class, two dance classes, three theater classes, one theater production class, one visual arts class, one piano class, four worship team classes, and one worship arts skills class.

Each day also has a chorus period with four choirs gathering alongside three adult leadership tracks. TMI offers 20 elective choices, allowing delegates to spend the week branching out beyond their “major” focus. These electives are intended to give students skills to take back their corps, rather than another performance opportunity.

Each major class ensemble and chorus performed during the week. Bands and choruses showcased their skills in a mid-week “preview” concert and a pair of final concerts at the end of the week. Creative arts groups put together a memorable “finale” on Wednesday, July 30, and individual performers took part in a dedicated Solo Recital early in the week.

“The artistic excellence was especially realized at the concerts, creative arts finale, and solo night, where students achieved the very highest standards,” said Simmons-Smith. “Each group performed with excellence and also with an attitude of praise and worship.”

The Solo Recital opened with a faculty band tribute to Major James Allison, performing “I Will Follow Him,” which was a favorite of Major Allison, a long-time dedicated supporter of music and arts programming. The bar of musical and artistic performance was very high during the evening, and a cornet solo, titled “The Carnival of Venice,” from Jonathan Wulu Tekasala, was perhaps the most raucously received of the solo performances.

Saturday, July 26, featured a concert from Wycliffe Gordon, a renowned musician, composer, arranger, and conductor. Gordon largely performed as a trombonist accompanied by a top-level ensemble. His set featured three Christian songs, which spoke deeply to those gathered. The concert provided a musical respite for delegates and staff but also showcased elite talent and what dedication and discipline to a craft can accomplish.

On Sunday, July 27, Colonel Deborah Sedlar, territorial chief secretary, visited TMI and poignantly challenged the delegates and staff to “keep your eyes on Jesus.”

“There are a lot of sensations out there, but not one is as good as Jesus,” Colonel Sedlar said. “He is the sensation of all sensations who both began and finished this race we’re in.”

“Keep your eyes on Jesus, the author, the perfecter of our faith. The One who we worship, the One to whom we pray, the One to whom we call out when we need help,” she continued. “Keep your eyes focused. And while you’re doing that, study hard. Be faithful. And know that your Salvation Army needs you. We need every one of you to be a part of the mission and ministry that takes place across this beautiful territory and beyond.”

On the penultimate day of TMI, 58 creative arts delegates and staff put together a memorable finale program, titled “Frame of Mind.” This program centered the week’s focus on spiritual disciplines divided into three category emphases on what Richard J. Foster, in his book “Celebration of Discipline,” outlines as inward practices, outward practices, and community practices.

Annually, the two-part final concert at TMI is both celebratory and worshipful, with each band, chorus, and worship team performing throughout the afternoon and evening. Within the first concert, the all-male Ditmer Chorus put forth a memorable rendition of “O Sifuni Mungu,” complete with solo vocals and dance choreography.

Within part two, a pair of newly commissioned pieces premiered. The TMI chorus, led by special guest Heather Osmond, sang “Spirit,” written by TMI staff member Dorothy Gates for the occasion. Then, the Holz Band, led by special guest Howard Evans, played “Forever, Amen,” written by Marcus Venables especially for the 2025 Holz Band. The final musical item of the week, also shared by the Holz Band, was “The Eternal Presence,” a tone poem from Eric Ball that challenged the delegates both musically and spiritually during the week.

Prior to the final two-part concert gathering on Thursday, July 31, the full institute gathered for morning worship led by Majors Hanover. The Holz Band and TMI chorus accompanied worship with Majors Hanover focusing on “Summing Up” the week with a focus on Luke 4:1-4. Major Nick Hanover spoke on the words of the famous hymn, “A Mighty Fortress,” highlighting the fact that “God’s truth abideth still, His Kingdom is forever.”

“May we always live in the truth of those words,” Major Hanover said. “May our lives always reflect His Kingship. Our attitudes and reactions reflect His Kingdom. May we always be aware of His presence in our lives, His provision and protection, His constancy. We worship Him this morning, grateful that He alone is our shield and defender, our fortress and refuge.”

During the worship service, delegates were encouraged to share short testimonies of what the Lord was doing in their lives during TMI. A few of these testimonies perfectly summed up the week, illustrating the two-pronged emphasis on spiritual formation and artistic excellence.

> *“I think God has put me exactly where I need to be this week at TMI.”*
> 
> *“He’s always been by my side and never left me.”*
> 
> *“In my darkest moments, He kept me close and in His hands”*
> 
> *“The Lord has provided a way where there seems to be no way.”*
> 
> *“He has changed me and made me new.”*

“The music and creative arts department really wanted TMI 2025 to be an impactful week that encouraged growth both artistically and spiritually,” said Tom Hanton, territorial worship arts education director and dedicated contact for TMI planning. “From our morning sessions learning about spiritual disciplines in morning manna to our evening sealed orders, our goal was for delegates to lean into their walk with Christ.

“I believe everyone left Asbury inspired by excellence and equipped by leaders to use spiritual disciplines in our art, our homes, our corps, and our communities to live like Christ.”
