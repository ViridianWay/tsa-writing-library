Miss Mary sat in her small RV, the remnant of what used to be her home. The widespread flooding event that impacted Jasper, Texas in April 2024 had swept away more than just material things—it had taken away the life she had built, leaving her in a constant fight for survival.

At 70 years old, Mary’s world had been turned upside down. Her brother, who was 82, had lost his home as well. She had been staying with him off and on, helping around the house, but after the flood, she found herself living outside in her broken-down RV. The tiny space was all she had left.

“It really was my home,” she says, recalling how the RV had once allowed her a sense of independence and warmth. Now, it was nothing more than a shell, broken and unusable.

But Mary’s story didn’t end there. The Salvation Army’s Emergency Disaster Services (EDS), in collaboration with Jasper Newton County Long Term Recovery Group (JNLTRG) and other partners, stepped in to help. Her life was about to change.

Mary received emergency funding from JNLTRG to purchase a small, empty shed which was then outfitted and completely transformed into a tiny home through the dedicated work of trained volunteers.

“The repair process has been life-changing,” Mary shares. “I’ve been living in that RV without heat or a way to cook. I couldn’t even take a shower. But now, I’m getting a little home. A warm one for the winter and cool in the summer. I can hardly believe it.”

In response to the flooding, JNLTRG worked with Mennonite Disaster Service and Harvest Call to provide free home repairs/rebuilds to survivors like Mary. The Salvation Army’s Texas Division EDS received a grant from Lowe’s to help purchase building materials for the project. That funding provided materials to repair 15 homes.

The generosity of the donors who provided the materials, and those who worked tirelessly to help build her tiny home, is something Mary will never forget. Her home, once a broken shell, was becoming a sanctuary—a place of warmth, security, and love.

“What would I say to the donors?” she asks, her voice filled with emotion. “I would say thank you. You’ve forever changed my life. I was surviving, but now I’m thriving. My life will never be the same.”

Mary’s story is one of loss, but also of incredible resilience and transformation. Through the support of The Salvation Army, and countless others, Mary was not just given a house, but a chance to live again.

“I’m thriving now,” she says with a smile. “Before, I was just surviving, but now I can see a future. A real home, a real life.”
