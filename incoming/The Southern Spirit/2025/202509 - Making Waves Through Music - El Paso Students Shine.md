El Paso Citadel Corps’ seventh annual Music & Arts Conservatory concluded joyfully and inspiringly with a graduation concert on Sunday, July 13, 2025. This local conservatory was established in response to the unique challenges posed by the distance to The Salvation Army’s Camp Hoblitzelle, its existence making advanced music and creative arts training more accessible to area youth. 

The four-week program welcomed 34 students this year, ages 8–14, for training in brass, choir, guitar, drama, and creative arts. But more than just a music program, the Conservatory is a ministry — a place where children grow not only in talent but in confidence, character, leadership, and faith. 

This year’s theme, “Make Waves,” was inspired by Isaiah 41:18. 

> *“I will make rivers flow on barren heights,*
> *and springs within the valleys.*
> *I will turn the desert into pools of water,*
> *and the parched ground into springs.”*

“We believe these young people can already make waves for God through their music and example,” says Corps Officer Major Eloisa Estrada, in spite of their youth or inexperience. 

Performances are a central part of the students’ educational journey in the Conservatory. Throughout the program, they participated in two Sunday worship services where they led several service elements including music, scripture, and drama, allowing students to experience meaningful public ministry.  

As part of the final graduation concert, students performed in brass bands, guitar ensembles, choirs, skits, and dramatic readings, showcasing the progress they made in their four weeks of study. Standout moments included “I’m So Blessed” by the massed choir, which featured a lively rap duet by two Conservatory students, a trumpet solo of “All That I Am” by instructor Diego Enriquez, and a heartfelt performance called “Gratitude” by the guitar ensemble led by instructor Dominick Rojas. Creative arts students also took the stage with a playful skit, “The Talent Show Parable,” directed by Cadet Sarah Herbert. 

This program has grown significantly since its beginning as a small corps-based effort. Today, it serves the wider El Paso community, not just corps youth. “This is the first year we’ve had so many students from outside northeast El Paso, where our corps is located,” says Corps Officer Major Floiran Estrada. “One of our students lived in Socorro [outside El Paso], and yet he was fully invested — never missed a day, always showed up ready to learn.” 

The graduation concert was not just a final performance but a celebration of transformation. Students who arrived unsure of their abilities at the beginning of the Conservatory left as confident performers and growing leaders. 

Each student was recognized with a certificate and medal for their hard work, and five top students received trophies for outstanding achievements. Special guest Major Jerry Friday, Texas divisional secretary for program, offered closing remarks and a benediction, thanking God for continuing to work through these young musicians making waves in their community.
