The Salvation Army has honored Gene, Jerry, and Charlotte Jones with the Order of Distinguished Auxiliary Service award, the highest award of acknowledgement and appreciation given to an advisory board member by the General, The Salvation Army’s international leader.

The Order of Distinguished Auxiliary Service award, which includes a certificate and three sets of ribbons and medals, was given to the Jones family for their ongoing dedication to The Salvation Army, which has most visibly included the National Red Kettle Kickoff during the Dallas Cowboys’ Thanksgiving Day game.

For nearly 30 years, the Jones family has been a beacon of hope for communities in North Texas and beyond through their unwavering support of The Salvation Army. They initiated the National Red Kettle Kickoff in 1997, transforming the Christmas fundraising effort into a nationally recognized event that has helped raise more than $3 billion dollars in the 27 years since. This innovative approach not only garners attention during the Dallas Cowboys’ Thanksgiving Day game, reaching 40 million viewers, but also unites artists and audiences in a powerful mission to combat poverty and homelessness. Their work has set a standard for corporate philanthropy and community engagement that inspires other partners to participate at a higher level.

Beyond national initiatives, the Jones family actively engages in local outreach, partnering with The Salvation Army North Texas Area Command on various programs that serve the community. From early Thanksgiving Day meals to Angel Tree gift donations, their hands-on approach exemplifies a profound commitment to improving lives.

“The Jones family’s exceptional service and leadership with The Salvation Army demonstrates the highest ideals of philanthropy and community responsibility,” says National Commander of the USA Salvation Army, Commissioner Kenneth Hodder (now recently retired). “Their legacy of compassion and commitment to helping others truly deserves recognition through this esteemed award to celebrate the impact they continue to make in our communities.”

“It’s hard to believe that our partnership with The Salvation Army spans three decades now. Over that time, we’ve developed such great respect and understanding for the depth of care and impact they have on those that need it most in our communities,” comments Dallas Cowboys Chief Brand Officer and Co-Owner Charlotte Jones.

“We treasure our long-standing relationship, and it is humbling for our family to be part of this critical work and an honor to be recognized internationally by The Salvation Army. National Commander Hodder leads an amazing organization that inspires us, and so many others, to help individuals and families in North Texas, across the country, and around the world.”

In February 1941, General George Carpenter of The Salvation Army instituted the Order of Distinguished Auxiliary Service award to mark the Army’s appreciation of distinguished service rendered by non-Salvationists who have helped to further its work in a variety of ways. The Jones family’s commitment to The Salvation Army exemplifies a dedication to service that has significantly improved the lives of countless individuals and families in need.

The Southern Territory joins National Headquarters and International Headquarters in saying thank you to the Jones family for their generous and unwavering support of The Salvation Army’s mission to meet human needs without discrimination. Their selfless service, along with that of all members of our advisory boards, women’s auxiliaries, advisory councils and committees, and Echelon chapters, enables us to feed the hungry, house the homeless, lift up the brokenhearted, and love the unloved every single day.

Thank you for coming alongside the officers, soldiers, and volunteers of The Salvation Army and supporting our mission to serve helpfully in the communities where we live.
