Salvationists of the Southern Territory are answering God’s call to make radical followers of Jesus Christ who *LOVE* inclusively, *SERVE* helpfully, and *DISCIPLE* effectively in the communities where they live. This is our mission statement and our mandate.

Two years ago, in our first year of our Territorial Priorities, we focused on ways to *DISCIPLE* effectively. Currently, we have just completed an amazing year focusing on how we *SERVE* helpfully in our corps and communities. By digging deeper into Recruitment, Youth, and Mission Integration and Development, we have seen incredible examples of our Army serving others in Jesus’ name throughout the Southern Territory. We have been encouraged by the stories, ideas, and testimonies in the “Southern Spirit” and on Salvation Army websites, as well as on your social media postings. Well done!

Now, we are excited to announce the next step in our journey together as we shift our focus to *“LOVE.”* We are called as Salvationists to *LOVE* inclusively, especially in the areas of Evangelism, Community Engagement, and Biblical Justice. Jesus demonstrated these by inviting all people to understand what the Kingdom of God is like. He also fully engaged his community, as everyone near him heard about the Father’s Kingdom, and he transformed their lives in practical ways. Jesus was also all about justice, making things right based upon his Father’s character and values, not our own.

The Apostle Paul beautifully summed it up in 1 Corinthians 13:

> *“Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrong. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices in the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails,”* (v 4-8a).

While we never stop discipling and serving others, this year we will highlight and lean into the creative and special ways that Salvationists are loving inclusively like Jesus in our communities across the Southern Territory. We can’t wait to see how God will use Salvationists, volunteers, and employees in His Army to *LOVE* others this year. *All for Jesus!*
