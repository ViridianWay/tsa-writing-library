Sunday, June 8 marked the **ordination and commissioning** of the Champions of the Mission session of cadets, as well as the concluding service of the 2025 Commissioning weekend. Colonel Deborah Sedlar welcomed those in attendance and watching online. 

“Today, we gather not only to witness the solemn declarations and joyful commissioning of these new officers in The Salvation Army, but to stand together on Pentecost Sunday, a day that reminds us of the unstoppable power of the Holy Spirit,” Colonel Sedlar said. “This morning, as we celebrate the calling and commitment and sending out of these Champions of the Mission, we also invite the Holy Spirit to move among us.” 

After the entrance of the Champions of the Mission and the congregational singing of “O Church Arise,” Major Zach Bell, president and principal of the Evangeline Booth College, presented the session of cadets. 

“Over the last two years in training, these cadets, these men and women, have grown closer to God,” Major Bell said. “They’ve grown closer to the call that God has placed upon their lives. The future of our Salvation Army is in great hands. I present to you dedicated soldiers of Jesus Christ who are armed and ready to preach the good news of Jesus Christ and to meet human needs in His name without discrimination.” 

A scripture presentation followed, focused on Acts 2:1-4, and transMission partnered with the Champions of the Mission on the singing of “Send the Fire.” Cadet Christopher Roman then gave a stirring presentation on the covenant signed by the cadets, and together the session recited the doctrines of The Salvation Army. 

Commissioners Kelly and Donna Igleheart presided over the ordination and commissioning of each soon-to-be lieutenant, praying over them as they enter the next step on their journey as Salvation Army officers. 

The Southern Staff Songsters shared a powerful rendition of “How Great Thou Art” as the morning’s offering was taken, followed by a parade of flags and the grand entrance of the newly commissioned lieutenants. Commissioner Donna Igleheart, territorial president of women’s ministries, and Salomon Elias, territorial sergeant major, then shared a blessing over the Champions of the Mission. 

“Officers of the Champions of the Mission session, I bless you in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ,” said Commissioner Donna. “Today, you take up the mantle of spiritual leadership as an officer of The Salvation Army. While your ordination and commissioning has been individual, you do not enter the battlefield alone. You will join a company of commissioned officers, local officers, and soldiers who welcome you and will work side-by-side with you in the great salvation war.” 

Lt. Jeremy Warf, serving as the session speaker for the Champions of the Mission, celebrated and challenged his session mates and fellow soldiers and officers. “Champions, I am so proud of you,” he said. “It has been a privilege to watch you grow. You are not just Champions of the Mission by title. You are living it. Salvation Army Southern Territory, thank you for believing in us. Thank you for sending us. Now, Salvation Army, let’s not wait for the help. Let’s be the help. Let’s go for souls, for eternity, for Jesus.” 

Commissioner Edward Hill shared the morning’s message, focusing on four things each of us need in pursuit of being a champion of the mission for Christ. “You’ve got to be saved. You’ve got to be sanctified. You’ve got to be a person of service. And you have to be willing to be sent,” he said. “If you are willing to do those things, you’ll be a good ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ.” 

He then said that The Salvation Army needs soldiers and officers “seeking in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for deliverance of the hurting, the helpless, and the hopeless” before asking a simple question: “Will you choose to be a sent person? The Lord and The Salvation Army need more champions of the mission.” 

Following the message, Commissioner Kelly Igleheart offered a call to mission, encouraging soldiers and attendees to pursue God and to embrace God’s calling, whether it be to full-time service as soldiers or as Salvation Army officers. 

Accompanied by a rousing march from the National Capital Band, the newly commissioned Lieutenants were sent out to their new divisions, stepping forward into their appointments, fulfilling their calling to serve God as Salvation Army officers. 

“And now,” Lt. Colonel Mark Israel proclaimed in benediction, “let this be an encouragement to each of us to continue to serve Jesus in the places where we live. May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.”
