Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has issued a commendation recognizing The Salvation Army of Georgia for its exceptional service to communities across the state over the past year. The commendation was received by Georgia Divisional Commander Major John Murphy in honor of the organization’s enduring dedication to preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and meeting human needs without discrimination.

In 2024, The Salvation Army of Georgia provided critical assistance to more than one million Georgia residents. This includes over 300,000 nights of safe shelter, more than 600,000 nutritious meals, and emergency financial assistance to more than 100,000 individuals and families in crisis. The organization’s commitment to serving Georgia’s most vulnerable populations remains steadfast through a variety of programs, including homeless shelters, food pantries, rehabilitation services, youth programs, and disaster relief efforts.

The commendation also highlighted The Salvation Army’s vital role in emergency disaster response, particularly following the devastation caused by Hurricanes Debbie and Helene. In the aftermath of these storms, Salvation Army teams provided immediate relief, including food, hydration, emotional and spiritual care, and financial assistance to thousands of affected families, reinforcing the organization’s mission to serve those in need during times of crisis.

Governor Kemp expressed his appreciation for The Salvation Army’s positive impact on Georgia communities, stating, “We really appreciate all that The Salvation Army does for the state of Georgia.”

“As we approach our 135th anniversary of service in Georgia next year, this commendation is a testament to the dedication of our officers, staff, volunteers, and supporters who make our work possible,” says Major John Murphy. “We are honored by this recognition and remain committed to serving our communities with compassion and care.”

The Salvation Army of Georgia’s impact is a testament to the power of kindness, generosity, and faith in action. Every meal served, every night of shelter provided, and every life touched is a reminder that hope is never out of reach. As the Georgia Division looks ahead to its 135th year of service, its commitment to uplifting communities and building a brighter future for all remains stronger than ever.
