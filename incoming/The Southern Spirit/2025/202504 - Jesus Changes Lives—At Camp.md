*I have had the privilege of experiencing camp in many ways. I’ve been a camper, a divisional youth secretary’s (DYS) kid, a summer staff member, a program staff officer, and even a DYS myself. Through all these roles, I’ve heard the same debate countless times:* **“Which camp is the best?”**

*Some camps have incredible ropes courses, huge pools, or access to lakes and rivers. People form deep emotional attachments to their camp, much like they do with sports teams. They passionately defend why their camp is the best. But why does this happen? The answer is simple:* **camp is personal.**

*These connections form because camp is where lifelong friendships are made. Campers return year after year, reuniting with friends and mentors who have shaped their lives. Staff members — whether counselors, lifeguards, maintenance workers, or even a DYS or music director — become larger-than-life role models. These relationships are often instrumental in a young person’s faith journey.*

*Over the years, I’ve heard countless testimonies from young people, cadets, and officers who point to camp as the place where they encountered God in a life-changing way. The phrase “* **camp changes lives** *” is often used, but I believe it needs a small but important correction:*

**Jesus changes lives—at camp.**

*Yes, camp is filled with incredible activities, relationships, and experiences, but what makes it truly life-changing is* **Jesus**. *And the best part? Jesus is not confined to one location. His presence is at every camp, in every experience, with every camper and staff member.*

*There is no better place to encounter Jesus than in the beauty of His creation. The outdoors magnifies His presence, offering moments of peace, reflection, and revelation. Psalm 19:1-4 captures this truth beautifully:*

> *“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them. Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”*

*Camp is special not because of ropes courses or lakes, but because it provides a space for young people to encounter the Creator. Whether experienced as a camper or staff member, camp is a place where relationships last a lifetime and faith takes root in ways that may never happen elsewhere.*

*So, which camp is the best camp? The one where Jesus is present. And that means every camp has the potential to change lives—because Jesus is there.*
