*“Serving Like Jesus” is a large part of our calling as Christians and Salvationists. As this year’s Commissioning theme and our current Territorial Priority focus, Commissioning weekend will feature an opportunity for delegates to SERVE by participating in a hands-on ministry experience.*

During the Saturday afternoon of Commissioning weekend, from 1:30-3:00 pm on June 7, Salvationists will be challenged to put their “feet on the street” and make personal ministry contact with people in the Atlanta area. At two designated locations, the Atlanta Kroc Center and the Woodward Elementary School, delegates will be encouraged to engage with people by participating at a variety of stations including a registration table, a prayer tent, distributing Bibles, face painting, handing out snacks, and manning festival activities. The National Capital Band, Southern Staff Songsters, and Territorial Arts Ministry team will also be present to provide additional ministry through music and the arts.

Major Lynda Thornhill, territorial mission, evangelism, and cultural ministries secretary, explains that through this outreach, “effort will be made to tell people about the Savior, Jesus Christ, that there is a Salvation Army church nearby that would welcome them with open and loving arms, and inform the people of the services offered by The Salvation Army, all while having fun.” This experience will also serve as a great model for corps when planning their own outreach ministries, she continues.

All attending Commissioning are encouraged to participate in this ministry opportunity, engaging in the mission of The Salvation Army in a practical and replicable way.

When registering online for Commissioning, delegates will be asked if they are interested in serving through this outreach ministry. Additionally, anyone attending Commissioning weekend will be able to check in at the outreach table in the lobby of Atlanta Temple for more information. Children will be welcome to join their families or corps officers to experience serving alongside their parents or mentors.

Those who have registered for this outreach opportunity will receive their assigned location when they check in at registration during Commissioning weekend. They will receive lunch directly following the Saturday morning session, meet with their location’s outreach coordinator for specific assignments and responsibilities, and then directly engage in ministry. At the end of this hands-on outreach time, participants will return to Atlanta Temple Corps for the rest of the scheduled afternoon Commissioning activities.

“Evangelism is not always easy,” Major Lynda shares. “You might not know how to approach someone or begin a conversation. Everyone attending the outreach will receive a ‘how-to’ for conversations with adults and children. Our hope is that through this hands-on experience, Salvationists will be confident not only that they’ve shared Jesus during Commissioning but can utilize these tools at their own Corps and train others to do the same.”
