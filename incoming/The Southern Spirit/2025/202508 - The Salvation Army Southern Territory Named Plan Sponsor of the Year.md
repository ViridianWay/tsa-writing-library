The Salvation Army Southern Territory, a retirement services customer of Corebridge Financial, was recently named a 2025 Plan Sponsor of the Year by *PLANSPONSOR* magazine for recent improvements made to their employee retirement plan.

The plan, which helps roughly 8,200 Salvation Army employees save for retirement with nearly $120 million in total assets, was recognized for recent efforts to help employees maximize their retirement potential.

Over the past 18 months, The Salvation Army Southern Territory and Corebridge have closely collaborated to enhance the plan with a simplified structure, automated features, increased matching contributions, and purposeful communications. As a result of these efforts, employee account balances have increased significantly.

Scott Strobel, pension and retirement plan director for The Salvation Army Southern Territory, says, “Our ultimate goal was to empower our employees to effortlessly engage in the retirement plan, reaping the benefits and achieving financial security. The changes we made had a big impact in driving engagement with the retirement plan and helping to recruit talented people to join our team.”

Corebridge President of Retirement Services Terri Fiedler comments, “The impact of The Salvation Army Southern Territory is felt far and wide throughout the communities it serves. It’s Corebridge’s honor to help the organization’s 8,000-plus employees secure their financial futures, so that when the time comes, each and every one are prepared to enjoy a well-deserved retirement following their years of service.”

The magazine awards nominees in 13 categories, allowing for the most accurate comparisons across plan types and sizes. For 2025, 144 nominations were received, 51 finalists selected, and the 13 winners announced and awarded at the awards dinner during the *PLANSPONSOR* National Conference. The Salvation Army Southern Territory was named the winner in the nonprofits with plan assets under $200 million category.
