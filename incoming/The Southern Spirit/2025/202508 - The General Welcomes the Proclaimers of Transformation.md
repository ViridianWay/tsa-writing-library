Following a week full of profound Bible study and teaching, this year’s annual Bible Conference culminated with a rousing and inspiring welcome to the cadets of the incoming Proclaimers of Transformation session. These individuals are entering the Evangeline Booth College (EBC) to study and train to become Salvation Army officers.

“As we come to the close of this powerful week, and as we have considered Kingdom living and awakening hope, we gather tonight with joy in our hearts to welcome the newest session of cadets, these proclaimers of salvation, the Proclaimers of Transformation,” Chief Secretary Colonel Deborah Sedlar declared. She then prayed, “May your Spirit rest upon these new cadets as they advance their journey of Kingdom living, awakening hope wherever they go.”

Territorial Candidate Secretary Captain Ashish Pawar welcomed the new cadets and cited their session scripture verse, 2 Corinthians 5:17. *“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come. The old has gone, the new is here.”*

“Proclaimers of Transformation, this is not just a name that was given, I feel like this is a declaration. This is a declaration of a mission on your heart that we are going to be proclaimers of the amazing transforming work that the Lord has done in our lives,” Captain Pawar told the cadets.

He then informed those present that, “These men and women have been called to stand up for Jesus and to proclaim. They come from the four corners of our great territory to love, serve, and disciple others as officers in The Salvation Army. God has prepared them for this moment through their faith journeys, life experiences, education, occupation, and corps ministries.”

The 20 new cadets, ranging from age 22 to 51, have varied backgrounds. Twelve are first generation Salvationists, seven are the children of soldiers, and five are officers’ kids. Twelve are corps cadet graduates. Their occupational and educational backgrounds range from human resources to political science, biomedical science, computer science, cosmetology, and instructional system design and technology. They bring between them nine children to join the EBC family.

Major Zach Bell, president and principal of the EBC, told the cadets, “As a territory, we welcome you. We are absolutely so elated that you are here. And we just can’t wait to see what God has in store for us and how God moves in and through each and every one of you.”

Following the official presentation of the session flag by Territorial Commander Commissioner Kelly Igleheart, Territorial Sergeant Major Salomon Elias welcomed the cadets on behalf of the soldiers of the Southern Territory. “I challenge you, stand up for Jesus, study hard, minister now, and let God prepare you fully to lead His Army into battle. We believe in you, we are praying for you, and we will be ready to follow your leadership as you follow Christ.”

A beautiful prayer of blessing followed from Commissioner Donna Igleheart, territorial president of women’s ministries: “Let their voices carry your truth, their hands extend compassion, and their lives reflect the transforming power of Christ wherever you send them.”

Commissioner Bronwyn Buckingham, world president of women’s ministries, then brought the cadets words of encouragement. “Thank you for every ‘yes’ to God that has brought you to this moment in time where we welcome you as cadets for training as Salvation Army officers. He alone knows the future purposes He has in store for each of you, but as you continue to offer your daily surrendered ‘yes,’ He will continue to unfold His plans for each and every one of you.”

Following a time of praise and worship led by special musical guests Karl and Lauren Westwood, General Lyndon Buckingham, the international leader of The Salvation Army, officially welcomed the Proclaimers of Transformation. “You sit here as a testimony that God still has work for this part of the body of Christ. He still has things for us to accomplish. He still wants us to be on mission. He still wants us to make a difference in the world. And you encourage my heart as the current leader of the Army.”

The General urged all those present to stay focused and determined, saying, “We’ve got a clear missional mandate. Our job is to do whatever we can to reveal the nature of the Kingdom of God and to draw people to the master.”

Major Israel Roseno, assistant principal for training and director of business administration for the EBC, provided a benediction, saying, “As we go from this place, may the God who makes all things new continue His transforming work in us. May we, like the Proclaimers of Transformation, leave as those who are in Christ, as new creations. May our words proclaim your truth, our actions reflect your grace, and our lives bear witness to your power that can change lives.”
