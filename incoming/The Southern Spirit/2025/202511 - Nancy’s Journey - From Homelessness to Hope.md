At 71 years old, Nancy faced a new reality she never imagined — homelessness. Alone and uncertain about the future, Nancy turned to The Salvation Army’s Center of Hope in Jackson, Mississippi. There she found the safety, support, and encouragement she desperately needed to begin her journey toward healing and stability.

“I needed a place to stay, to find hope, and to get back on track,” Nancy shares, reflecting on her initial arrival at the Center of Hope. “At first, I couldn’t believe it. I wondered, ‘Why am I here?’ But eventually, things fell into place.”

Under the care and guidance of the center’s dedicated staff, Nancy began to rebuild her life. The road wasn’t easy, but with each passing day, she grew stronger and more hopeful.

“I learned to count on the Lord, and sometimes that takes a while,” Nancy says with a smile. “I’ve grown a lot, thanks to The Salvation Army. I am so thankful for the staff and everything they’ve done for me.”

Rolanda Alexander, program director for The Salvation Army of Jackson, remembers the day Nancy arrived at the Center of Hope. “Nancy came to us about a year ago,” Rolanda recalls. “She just showed up, and she was the sweetest thing. Once she came in, she was thankful, because she had been on the streets.”

With the support of The Salvation Army’s programs, Nancy worked hard to regain her independence. The Center of Hope provided her with not only shelter and meals but also the resources and encouragement she needed to transition into a new chapter of her life.

“Miss Nancy went through our program, and we were able to transition her into permanent stable housing,” Rolanda explains. “Now, she is doing great and has moved from homelessness to self-sustainability.”

Nancy’s journey is a testament to the life-changing impact that The Salvation Army’s Center of Hope can have on individuals facing homelessness. It’s a story of finding strength in faith, community, and the unwavering support of those who care.

Her story reminds us that it’s never too late to find hope and healing, no matter how difficult the circumstances. Today, she’s living in her own home, a testimony to the resilience and determination that carried her through her darkest days.

As Nancy reflects on her journey, her gratitude shines through: “I am so thankful for The Salvation Army and the staff. They’ve done so much for me, and I couldn’t have made it without them.”

Nancy’s story is just one of many, but it highlights the profound difference that compassion, faith, and community support can make in the lives of those who need it most.
