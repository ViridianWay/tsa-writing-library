Ricky’s story is one of resilience, transformation, and the power of second chances. As a young man in Florida, Ricky made choices that led him down a dark path, ultimately resulting in a 27-year prison sentence. When he was finally released, the world outside had changed beyond recognition, and Ricky found himself facing an uncertain and frightening future.

With little more than the clothes on his back and a heart full of uncertainty, the temptation to return to his old life loomed large. That’s when his cousin stepped in with a lifeline. Encouraging Ricky to leave Florida behind, his cousin suggested he move to Mississippi and enter The Salvation Army’s Center of Hope program.

“The Salvation Army program facilitated integration back into society,” Ricky reflects. “What The Salvation Army did for me was it gave me shelter. It gave me church. It gave me a community. It gave me access to their counselors, their social workers. It was just amazing.”

At the Center of Hope, Ricky discovered a supportive community that embraced him with open arms. The Salvation Army offered him shelter, spiritual guidance, and a sense of belonging that had been missing for so long. Through the program, Ricky gained access to caring professionals who helped him navigate the challenges of reintegration.

But the support didn’t stop there. Recognizing Ricky’s potential and determination, The Salvation Army offered him his first job since his release — sorting clothing donations at their thrift store.

“After 11 months, I had saved enough money to get my own place.” Ricky recounts.

With steady work and a newfound sense of purpose, Ricky’s life began to change. Soon he was able to secure his own home and begin his own small business.

“Today, I am super proud,” Ricky says with a smile. “My wife and I have a beautiful child, and I have a small business that centers around software development.”

Ricky’s transformation from a former inmate to a proud business owner and family man is nothing short of remarkable. But his journey didn’t end there. Ricky felt a calling to give back. He now visits prisons, hoping to inspire others who are still behind bars.

“I go to prisons to share my testimony, and my hope is that the story of my life will bring them some comfort,” Ricky explains. “But more importantly, I want to remind those incarcerated that there is a plan.”

Ricky is not only a success story but also a beacon of hope for others who may feel lost or trapped by their circumstances. His journey serves as a reminder that with faith, support, and hard work, anyone can overcome their past and build a life filled with purpose and fulfillment.
