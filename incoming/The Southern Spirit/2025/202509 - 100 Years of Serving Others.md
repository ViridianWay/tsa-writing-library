The Salvation Army Tampa Corps was honored to host the 100th birthday celebration of Major Essie Lescano in mid-July. Family, current and retired Salvation Army officers, and many friends gathered for a special lunch celebrating her birthday, sharing hugs, memories, and blessings.

Major Essie has an amazing story that is still being written. She grew up in and has served through The Salvation Army all of her 100 years, using the gifts God has given her to preach, minister, paint, write, and so much more. She has directly and indirectly impacted thousands of lives over the years for Jesus. God has given the world such a gift in Major Essie, and we are thankful He continues to allow us to learn from her.

Major Essie Lescano was born in Tampa, FL on July 25, 1925. She married on September 27, 1942, and she and her husband entered the Evangeline Booth College for officer training in 1948. Their first appointment was in Nashville, TN. From there they served in Baltimore, MD, Phoenix, AZ, and Santa Monica, CA, before returning to Anderson, SC. The Majors Lescano retired in 1987. She now resides back in Tampa, loved and cared for by family, friends, and of course, her Tampa Corps family.

“What keeps me going every day? My love for the Lord,” Major Essie tells us. Also, “love for the people is what keeps us going.”

Major Essie, we honor you, celebrate you, and pray God’s continued blessing, favor, and protection over you. We are thankful for you and your investment, commitment, and obedience in ministering to others, sharing the love of Jesus Christ, and providing learned wisdom and revelation through the truth of the gospel over the years. Your life is a testament and brilliant example of sharing the love of Jesus and caring for those in need without discrimination.
