Southern Territorial leaders Commissioners Kelly and Donna Igleheart were recently blessed to spend time with our Salvationist brothers and sisters in Luanda, Angola. Beginning their time in early February at a packed Atlantico Stadium, the festive atmosphere reverberated with over 2,000 voices ringing out in worship.

During the week, Commissioners Igleheart came alongside the Angolan leaders through their officers’ councils, sharing messages of leading from within, being rooted in holiness, and finding hope through being grounded in Christ.

Throughout their visit, Commissioners Igleheart were able to experience firsthand the incredible work God is doing through The Salvation Army in Angola. His light was evident in the employees at Territorial Headquarters and shone brightly through the school hallways at Colégio William Booth, reflected on the faces of the joyful students.

At an area known as Golf2, Commissioners Igleheart witnessed the faithful service of a single officer ministering in their community. In this humble corps setting, they joined in prayer with the men and women who support this special ministry, standing together in faith for a permanent structure to welcome even more neighbors home.

During their final days in Angola, Commissioners Igleheart shared a powerful message encouraging believers of all ages to carry Christ’s light into their homes, schools, universities, and workplaces. Sunday worship at the Corimba Corps transcended language barriers as hearts were united in praise.

As the Angola Territory continues to rise together — united, connected from the roots up, and shining Christ’s light for all to see — we celebrate their commitment to being ALL FOR JESUS. Let’s continue to lift up our brothers and sisters in Angola!
