For the first time in more than a half-decade, the talented young people from a pair of divisional ensembles from the North & South Carolina (NSC) Division ventured outside the Southeast for a weekend of ministry and fellowship. From October 23-28, the Carolinas Divisional Youth Band and the division's acting and dance troupe, Lights Up!, visited the Del Oro Division, which covers northern California and northern Nevada.

The first full day was spent in rehearsal at the Del Oro Camp & Conference Center in Nevada City, California. Following that important preparation, the ensembles visited and ministered outside the California State Capitol in Sacramento on the morning of Friday, October 25.

“We had one couple come by who said they were just visiting Sacramento,” says Aaron Jackson, divisional music director. “They heard what they recognized as Christian music and wanted to come and just sit and listen. So, they pulled up two chairs and sat the whole time.”

Friday evening brought the ministry teams to The Salvation Army’s Adult Rehabilitation Center (ARC) in Stockton, California.

“If I had to pick one moment that stood out during the trip, it was probably the ARC visit,” Jackson shares.

Lights Up! and the band each performed, with a Jesus Theater presentation serving as a key centerpiece of the evening. That was followed by a poignant devotional from Captain Chris Raymer, corps officer in Greensboro, North Carolina, and a chaperone for the trip.

“Our visit to the ARC was a true highlight,” declares Captain Raymer. “The men were clearly overjoyed to have us and many of them walked away that night with a deeper understanding of God’s love for them.”

During the weekend, the young people were fortunate to spend some time sightseeing, including a meal at In-n-Out Burger and a visit to Fisherman’s Wharf, a leading tourist center in San Francisco. The schedule remained busy, however, and Saturday evening featured a concert at The Salvation Army’s Suisun City Kroc Center.

This concert was a collaboration with the Del Oro Youth Chorus, led by Divisional Music Director Daniel Prince, who was also a valuable liaison for the entire weekend. The groups came together to sing a piece focused on Revelation 19:1 during the concert.

“It was very nice to have the two divisions come together and sing,” Jackson shares. “Singing is a powerful tool partly because everyone can do it, and there is power in being able to share scripture in that form as well.”

As with any weekend of this magnitude, there are many moving parts, necessitating total cooperation from the young people and the navigation of countless logistics. The spirit of the groups was encouraging and positive, with a focus on the common goal of powerful ministry.

“We really had a great weekend,” Captain Raymer says. “I was most impressed seeing our younger players and creative arts group members get involved with the logistics like setting up, moving equipment, and just pitching in together. Everyone took a role and saw it through.”

The journey concluded with a full slate of activities on Sunday, October 27, including an outdoor concert in the Folsom area. Sunday morning worship for the groups took place at the Sacramento Citadel Corps, with the message provided by NSC Divisional Commander Lt. Colonel Ronnie Raymer. As Jackson notes, the theme and focus of the artistic repertoire was on coming to the altar and laying one’s sins down. “It was a throughline in each meeting, and it was received very well at the corps,” says Jackson. “Everyone was understanding of this central message and that we all need to come to Christ. It was impactful.”

While the trip itself was both memorable and powerful, it was also the culmination of extensive work. That includes regular rehearsals, meticulous planning, and the individual choice of each young person to allocate the required time and effort.

“I think going on this trip and all of the preparation for it was
