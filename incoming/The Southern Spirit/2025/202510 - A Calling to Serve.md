# A Calling to Serve

As a boy, Munya Pamacheche knew all about God and His Word. The lad was one of five children growing up in a Christian home carefully and prayerfully directed by his Salvation Army officer parents, Christopher and Florence Pamacheche. Munya’s dad was Promoted to Glory in 2007, but his mom, Major Florence, “continues to be my rock.”

“Our evening routine never varied: the television was off by eight o’clock, and the family gathered for reading the Bible (they took turns reading a chapter each night) and family prayer,” Munya recalls.

But just growing up in a Christian home doesn’t get you into Heaven. By age 16, Munya, attending the Mazowe High School operated by The Salvation Army in Harare, began to wonder what a closer relationship on his own with God would look like.

“Through the years, I watched as my parents went from corps to corps in Zimbabwe, and I witnessed them serving humanity. I began to long for something like that for myself,” he says.

“God’s provision was always there for me,” he says emphatically, but he yearned for a calling to serve.

Munya enrolled in the University of Zimbabwe with a major in economics and finance. At The Salvation Army, he faithfully served as a soldier of the Harare Citadel Corps and directed the youth band.

“One night I was walking home from university, and it was pouring down rain, and I was drenched,” Munya says. “A soldier from another corps was driving along and saw me walking. She pulled up beside me and offered me a ride so I could get out of the rain.”

While they motored down the streets of Harare, she asked Munya a question that changed his life: “Do you think you’d like to study abroad in America?”

She was speaking on behalf of a couple already in the United States who wanted to sponsor a Salvationist student by covering costs for travel and tuition. The only two conditions: they must be willing to help faithfully in a corps and must maintain at least a 3.0 grade point average.

Both conditions would be easily met for Munya, so he agreed and later relocated to Greenwood, South Carolina, where he would assist the officers in corps programs as well as enrolling in nearby Lander University. He changed his major to a Bachelor of Science in business, finance, and healthcare.

Upon graduation, Munya was urged to apply for a vacant position in the Finance Department at the North & South Carolina Divisional Headquarters. His qualifications made for an easy hire, and with his move to Charlotte, Munya’s dual ministry began as director of accounting for the division and assistant corps sergeant major (A/CSM) at the Charlotte Temple Corps.

Munya describes his life journey so far as “mind blowing.” He says he identifies with young David in the Old Testament, who was the most unlikely choice by God and the prophet Samuel to be anointed king of Israel.

“God’s provision for my life has always been there,” he says, “but I never dreamed I would be called by Him to do all I’m able to do in ministry here. Coming to America alone was a huge answer to prayer.”

God has continued to be faithful in answering Munya’s prayers. He became a naturalized American citizen on August 7, 2023. He married Ashley, who he met while attending Lander University. Ashley, originally from the Bahamas, was recently enrolled as a soldier of the Charlotte Temple Corps, and together they have one child.

Munya’s contributions to the division and the Charlotte Temple Corps continue to be amazing, and he considers all he does for the Lord and the Army to be an honor, “and I take that very seriously. I pray I can be anointed by God, and I would never take leadership for granted.”

Munya finds one of his most vital ministry opportunities is helping to lead a Thursday morning men’s Bible study, using an app that takes you through the Bible. So far, the group has covered Luke, Acts, and Galatians, and Munya marvels at “the renewing of my mind through the Holy Spirit as we read the Word together.”

After being installed as A/CSM by the (then) divisional commander, Lt. Colonel Ronnie Raymer, Munya was tasked with a project by CSM Ed Laity.

“As strange as it sounds, Ed asked me to go to another church that Sunday and simply observe what they are doing to grow their numbers,” Munya explains. “I came away from that visit impressed of three things: They had ‘greeters’ who made sure everyone was most welcome, they took special note of prayer requests from everyone present, and they conducted a coordinated ‘follow-up’ to encourage a return to their church.”

His prayer is that his actions will have impact and that he will continue to be used by God while following the Lord’s leading.

“Since I’ve been here at the Temple Corps, we have had four or five changes of corps officers. With each change comes different styles of leadership, and I see my appointment as A/ CSM to help provide a ‘steady presence’ as a local officer for the corps family to look to during the adjustment process,” Munya says.

“That alone is a calling of ministry, actually chosen and anointed by God for the extension of His Kingdom and for His glory and honor!”
