The Southern Staff Band (SSB), Southern Staff Songsters (SSS), and Territorial Arts Ministry team (TAM) all had the privilege of supporting this year’s SAROA (Salvation Army Retired Officers Association) reunion in St. Petersburg, Florida. Alongside special guests Commissioners Kelly and Donna Igleheart, Southern Territorial leaders, and with the support of Florida Divisional leaders Lt. Colonels Kent and Melody Davis, the Southern groups provided poignant moments of worship, reflection, and celebration for all those gathered.

Over the course of two days, retired officers from all four USA territories and the Canada and Bermuda Territory met to fellowship, hear words of encouragement, remember fallen comrades, and discuss their continuing roles of ministry in The Salvation Army. Commissioners Igleheart alternated speaking at each session, bringing messages on the current state of the Southern Territory, the importance of the foundational work done by past officers, the need for continued encouragement of fellow officers both here and overseas, and how we never retire from our calling to be Christians ministering to those around us.

> “Your commission didn’t end with retirement. The passion God placed in you may have changed form, but it hasn’t disappeared,” Commissioner Donna told the gathered officers. “This season that you’re in…your mission field may have changed, but your mission hasn’t. I can assure you of that.”

The territorial groups performed selections that enhanced the event’s themes and brought everyone into a space of worship. TAM presented two particularly powerful pieces including “Let Me Tell You My Story,” highlighting the stories of several Army pioneer missionaries, and “Lord, If Your Presence,” a combined number utilizing all three worship arts groups.

Nick Simmons-Smith, territorial music & creative arts education secretary, said of the event, “The retired officers are an inspiration — so many years of service in one room! It was good to meet them and hear their stories — they were very encouraging about all three groups’ presentations.”

## Southern Staff Band

Following the multi-ensemble support in St. Petersburg, the Southern Staff Band proceeded across the state to the Orlando Citadel Corps. Their Saturday evening concert there featured a wide-ranging program, including an arrangement of the classical piece “Claire de Lune” and a vintage Salvation Army work in “Resurgam,” a tone poem from Eric Ball. Matt Broome, divisional music director for the Texas Division and a former soldier of the Orlando Citadel Corps, shared his testimony, and Major Mike Harris, area commander in Greenville, South Carolina, and a tuba player in the band, delivered a devotional on righteousness before introducing a moving rendition of “Amazing Grace.”

On Sunday morning, Lt. Colonel Mark Israel, territorial secretary for program, shared thoughts on faithfulness, focusing on the words of Hebrews 13:8. He also spoke of his spiritual and familial roots in the Orlando Citadel Corps. “As I reflect on those generations of family and see others here today, I am reminded, once again, that God is faithful,” he said. “He provides for us. Don’t grow weary. He remains the same yesterday, today, and forever, and His faithfulness and love to us endure through a thousand generations.”

Bandmaster Simmons-Smith tells us, “The Orlando corps was buzzing on Sunday morning. After a fun-filled celebration on Saturday night, the packed congregation gave their all in worship on Sunday morning. It was like heaven!”

## Southern Staff Songsters

While the band ministered in Orlando, the songsters made the short trek to the Clearwater Citadel Corps where they presented an evening of music and worship themed “How Great Thou Art.” Filling the chapel with songs like Joseph M. Martin’s “Proclaim the Works of the Lord,” Craig Courtney’s “Thou Art Holy,” and Dan Forrest’s titular “How Great Thou Art,” the SSS lifted their voices to declare the glory of God.

Lt. Colonel Carolee Israel, territorial secretary for spiritual life development and officer development, presented a devotional for the evening on the importance of making space in ourselves to encounter God. “Our lives should be the space where the Holy Spirit dwells, and those around us should be able to see the evidence of that,” she said. “This space of encounter now becomes a place of surrender.”

Sunday morning brought the opportunity for the songsters to support the holiness service. In addition to providing musical selections throughout the service, group members also joined the brass band, led praise and worship, and read scripture. SSS member René Jarvis gave her testimony, declaring, “All God wanted and wants from me is a surrendered heart and will… He wants the same from each and every one of you.”

## Territorial Arts Ministry Team

After concluding their time at SAROA, the Territorial Arts Ministry team travelled to the Tampa Adult Rehabilitation Center (ARC) where they held creative workshops, using theater games and techniques to emphasize the value of all members of the Body of Christ. They also worked together with workshop participants on a performance piece that they all performed the next day for the call to worship during the ARC’s Sunday morning service.

“Arts ministries are a powerful tool for spreading the gospel,” says Bethany Farrell, territorial creative arts director. “As exciting as it is when TAM has the opportunity to perform, being able to lead people in workshops is one of the best things we do. This weekend, we were able to witness the transformation that took place at the ARC as many ladies walked in shy and uncertain but left confident and smiling with God’s Word on their lips, excited about sharing their message with others. It’s such a beautiful thing to be a part of!”

Following the ARC Sunday service, TAM moved to the Tampa Corps where they supported the holiness meeting through a scriptural medley presentation entitled “Wondrous Love,” and a moving dance later in the worship service.

Members from all three territorial groups spoke about how rich and personal their moments of worship during the weekend were, both together at SAROA and in their separate ministry locations, enabling them to bring their audiences along with them to the throne of God.

Simmons-Smith tells us, “All three groups worked really hard all weekend. It always amazes me what can be accomplished with so little rehearsal time. Surely our ministry was blessed by the Lord!”
