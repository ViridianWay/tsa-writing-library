New Years celebrations in the city of New Orleans turned tragic early in the morning of January 1, when a truck drove through the crowds of revelers, killing and injuring many. 

In response, the city of New Orleans, as well as federal law enforcement, homeland security, and members of the National Guard began round-the-clock operations throughout the French Quarter and the blockaded investigation area. 

At the request of Homeland Security, The Salvation Army’s Emergency Disaster Services stationed a mobile feeding unit on each end of Canal Street and ran 24-hour service with coffee, hot chocolate, cold drinks, and snacks. Throughout the cold night and into the next morning, crews drove ATVs up and down Canal Street serving grateful first responders. 

Representatives from the New Orleans Department of Homeland Security thanked The Salvation Army for the speed and efficacy of the response. Major Ed Binnix, incident commander for this event and area commander for the New Orleans Salvation Army, said, “While we very much regret the circumstances, we are honored to be able to serve. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the witnesses, survivors, and loved ones whose lives have been upended.”
