For many years, Southern Territorial Salvation Army fundraising teams and community relations professionals have rightfully been celebrated for their contributions to the Army’s mission at its annual territorial Community Relations and Development (CRD) Conference. But it was only recently that the territory fully recognized the vital role that divisional communications directors play in raising funds and supporting field relations across the territory.

2025 marked the first year that the Southern Territory elevated the communications function in the award space at its annual CRD Conference held in mid-February, introducing the Excellence in Communication award.

As the award states, the following incredibly talented and dedicated communications professionals were awarded **“in recognition of exceptional leadership, strategic vision, and excellence in communications. Demonstrating the highest standards of our mission and core values:”**

* **Aimee Murry** *(Alabama-Louisiana-Mississippi Division)*
* **Cindy Fuller** *(Arkansas-Oklahoma Division)*
* **Eric Short** *(Kentucky-Tennessee Division)*
* **Shelley Henderson** *(North & South Carolina Division)*
* **Philip Burn** *(Texas Division)*

Each of these professionals excels in various communication skills that benefit their divisions, ultimately strengthening the entire territory. Congratulations to these first award recipients and thank you to all our communications professionals around the Southern Territory. Your excellence and your heart for the mission of The Salvation Army empower us to impact the world.
