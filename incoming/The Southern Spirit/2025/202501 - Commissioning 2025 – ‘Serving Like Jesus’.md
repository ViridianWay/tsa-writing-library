Salvationists from across the USA Southern Territory are encouraged to gather in Atlanta from Friday, June 6 through Sunday, June 8 for what promises to be an inspiring and memorable weekend of worship, fellowship, and service. The 2025 Commissioning Weekend will take place at the Atlanta Temple Corps, and, following a memorable time in 2024 under the banner of “Walking Like Jesus,” we will continue our journey through the Southern Territorial Priorities with a 2025 theme of “Serving Like Jesus.”

“We needed all of the emphasis of this event to be on Jesus,” says Roberta Simmons-Smith, territorial director of special events. “So, we were led to choose a scripture that reminded us that we must serve the way He served.”

The theme verse for the weekend is Mark 10:45, “For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (NIV). The Territorial Priority for this year is SERVE, with an intentional focus on recruitment, youth, and mission integration and development.

During the weekend, the Champions of the Mission session of cadets will be ordained and commissioned. The first event will be the Commencement service, held on Friday morning, and the weekend will conclude with the Ordination service on Sunday, celebrating the newest Salvation Army officers in the Southern Territory.

The esteemed special guests for the weekend include Commissioners Edward and Shelley Hill. Commissioner Edward serves as the Chief of the Staff at International Headquarters, and Commissioner Shelley is the world secretary for women’s ministries. We anticipate their international perspective on serving like Jesus around the Army world having an exciting impact on our territory.

In addition to the general sessions and programming, a full slate of youth offerings is in place for the weekend. “Once again, these programs promise to be unforgettable and life-changing for our young people as they, too, go deeper in their faith,” Simmons-Smith says. The ACCENT Childcare team will return and host children between six months and four years old. There will also be a dedicated Youth Conference for children between five years old and twelve years old.

The full schedule will be released at a later date, though Simmons-Smith encourages young adults especially to attend, revealing a Saturday night focus for that age group. “While the whole weekend will be filled with opportunities to go deeper in your faith, the Saturday night will be geared with YOU specifically in mind,” she says. “Saturday night’s program will be filled with exciting worship experiences and encouragement in your faith journey. Both young and old alike will want to experience this dynamic night of worship!”

Registration officially opens in February, including sign-ups for both Childcare and the Youth Conference. An email will be distributed to all officers and employees when the registration link is available, and it will also be shared on all territorial platforms. Of note, Friday, May 30 will be the deadline for registration for all youth activities, though general attendees can register until the start of the Commissioning events.

“At this year’s Commissioning, we can guarantee that you will not only be given the tools and inspiration to serve but also a hands-on opportunity to serve the local community during the event,” Simmons-Smith shares. “There will be more exciting details coming soon, but we are all going to get the opportunity to bring the Church into the community on Saturday afternoon, putting into practice how we are to be Heart to God and Hand to Man.”

Join us for an exciting and unforgettable time learning to serve like Jesus!
