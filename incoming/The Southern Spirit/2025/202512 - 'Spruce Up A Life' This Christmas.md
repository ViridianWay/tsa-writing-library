For more than 35 years, The Salvation Army’s “Spruce Up A Life” initiative has brought joy to families in Enid, Oklahoma. The program, which completes its 36th year with the 2025 Christmas season, runs separate but parallel to the Angel Tree program in Enid with the aim of providing local families with fully decorated Christmas trees and gifts for the entire family unit.

“Spruce Up A Life” serves a maximum of 50 families per year, in part due to what Captain Amanda Brittle, corps officer, describes as “a huge undertaking.” Families are often identified for “Spruce Up A Life” through The Salvation Army’s social services programming, and that connection sometimes occurs during Angel Tree registration itself. The initiative is capped at 50 families so that the command can be sure to secure sponsorship for each tree and family.

“Once a family is identified, the process is very similar to Angel Tree,” Captain Brittle explains. “We gather all of the children’s sizes and sizes for everyone in the home. Oftentimes, that includes an aunt or an uncle or grandparents as well. We interview the family and gather their wishes in the way we would typically do for Angel Tree.

“Then, we send out letters to previous sponsors and insert an ask in our newsletter to try and get new donors. We lean on our local partners to help us spread the word, whether it’s a local car wash, a lawyer’s office, a car dealership, even a local radio station like Williams Broadcasting here. We are blessed to have help.”

Each tree is separately sponsored, either by an individual, family, or local organization or collective. “Our sponsors really cover a wide range of people,” says Captain Brittle. “All kinds of people. It’s very neat to see.”

Captain Brittle continues, “Once the donors are located, they come to us at our Christmas warehouse. We buy and gather six-anda- half-foot, pre-lit trees. Then, the donor covers that cost and also the cost of the boxes we use in preparation for a pick-up by UPS.”

Distribution traditionally occurs in the week prior to Enid’s Angel Tree distribution, and the entire program is enhanced through a fruitful partnership with UPS. In fact, the 2025 Christmas season is the 29th year of the local alliance with UPS.

Larry Miller, who worked for UPS for 45 years before retiring in August 2025, unquestionably pushed the “Spruce Up A Life” partnership to a new level beginning in 1997.

“The story goes that, when this first began, Larry Miller saw families trying to strap trees to their cars and having all kinds of trouble,” Captain Brittle says. “He reached out to The Salvation Army and that helped to strike up a partnership that has been ongoing for almost 30 years.”

UPS graciously allows The Salvation Army to use its trucks and fuel, though UPS delivery employees are not paid for the initiative. Instead, the drivers volunteer to help with the program to aid local families in need.

“The feedback we receive from UPS drivers and employees is always great,” Captain Brittle shares. “They love it. Every year, we know that they’re almost fighting over who gets to help. I have so many memories and photos of UPS employees who involve their whole families to help, and it’s become a wonderful tradition.”

Captain David Brittle, Enid corps officer and also a former UPS employee, offered insight that, rather than using bags to transport the trees, they should be placed in wardrobe boxes that are more fit to move in UPS trucks designed to hold boxes. This was a successful innovation which allowed for more efficient and effective delivery.

Overall, Captain Amanda Brittle describes a “big friendship” with UPS, saying “we try to acknowledge them throughout the year, including on National Donut Day, and we recently gave them a corporate sponsorship award. They’re fantastic partners to us.”

While not every Salvation Army command may have a similar connection to UPS or a dedicated local partner like Larry Miller, “Spruce Up A Life” does display the power of local partnerships that can form long-lasting bonds and make a significant community impact.

“I think ‘Spruce Up a Life’ is just really cool,” Captain Amanda says. “For me, it’s maybe the most fun, neatest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. My understanding is that there’s nothing quite like it in our Salvation Army locations. I really applaud the people who put this in motion. It’s a neat program, and so many people are helped by it.”

And, amid Christmas seasons that are unquestionably busy, “Spruce Up A Life” has routinely provided a local reminder of the impact of The Salvation Army in Enid.

“I don’t think the reality of what we’re doing with ‘Spruce Up a life’ fully hit home for me until last Christmas. One of the recipients came back to us in absolute tears,” shares Captain Brittle. “They were overwhelmed by everything that we did and what they received. They wanted to share their story and what led them to this position.”

The initiative’s impact also goes well beyond meeting human need, opening doors for ministry and being the face of Jesus Christ in the community.

“‘Spruce Up A Life’ has opened the doors to pray for people, talk to them, minister to them. There are so many stories like that. I think these are things that we can sometimes overlook when we’re doing Christmas work in the Army,” Captain Brittle says. “Sometimes, it can be a thing that we have to do. But we should remember the people’s lives that are touched. We don’t always get to see the other side, but hearing testimonies of people who are helped is a powerful reminder.”
