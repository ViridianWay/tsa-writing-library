Youth Councils, The Salvation Army’s annual divisional youth retreat, brings youth and young adults together in their divisions for an intentional time of spiritual growth and renewal every year. “It’s really a chance for the divisions to just pour into the discipleship of young people,” says Major Jamie Satterlee, territorial youth secretary.

This year was no exception as young people across the Southern Territory gathered to experience an “Overflow” of God’s goodness while focusing on the theme verse 2 Corinthians 9:12: *“This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord’s people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.”*

Featuring a wide range of guest speakers, special events, and fun activities, each division presented this theme to their youth in a unique way that spoke directly to the needs of their young people.

The *Alabama-Louisiana-Mississippi* Division opened their weekend with a session focusing on mental health called “Overwhelmed.” Each delegate received an anxiety relief sticker as they heard testimonies from mentors and peers. Later, an “Overflow in Worship” concert in the park featured youth-led worship.

In spite of last-minute changes, this year became one of the *Arkansas-Oklahoma* Division’s best Youth Councils in recent memory, marked by creativity, joy, and transformation as they worked together and leaned into the Holy Spirit’s leading in all things.

The *Florida* Division’s weekend had a consistent audible reminder as the running water of a fountain gave a tangible representation of the overflow of the Holy Spirit in their lives. At the end of the event, each delegate filled up a small bottle from the fountain to take home, a memento of their time in God’s presence and a reminder to let Him overflow in their lives.

Impact neighborhood and camp service projects gave delegates from the *Georgia* Division a chance to put into practice the overflow of God’s grace through thanksgiving and love in action.

In the *Kentucky-Tennessee* Division, officers, cadets, and leaders washed delegates’ hands during one memorable worship service, exemplifying what it looks like to serve others in love.

The *North & South Carolina* Division’s Youth Councils featured a “Thrifted Gala,” a fun and creative way to introduce and incorporate the ministry of The Salvation Army’s Adult Rehabilitation Centers for their youth. Delegates also learned biblical truths about the importance of confession and community.

The *Potomac* Division’s Youth Councils began even before delegates arrived with a road trip challenge, encouraging young people to spread messages of love on their way to the event. Later, practicing overflowing service, delegates went on a prayer journey through the National Mall, concluding with an outreach concert at the Lincoln Memorial.

The *Texas* Divisional Youth Praise Team led worship for the weekend of their Youth Councils, allowing their strong group of young worship leaders to bring their peers into God’s presence. Delegates were given opportunities to mentor and pray with younger attendees, and a night of free worship allowed the Holy Spirit to move in powerful ways.

In total across the territory, Youth Councils 2025 brought together:

* 2,361 youth and young adults
* 2,435 moments at the altar seeking Jesus
* 133 young people interested in Salvation Army officership

The Holy Spirit is alive and moving in the lives of our young people in every division across the Southern Territory. May they continue to grow and overflow with God’s goodness and love, leading them to pour out His grace into the world around them!
