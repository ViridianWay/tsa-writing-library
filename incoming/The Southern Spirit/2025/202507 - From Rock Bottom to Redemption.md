When Lieutenant Micah Gallagher first met Ken Taylor at The Salvation Army’s Mission Station, he didn’t see a broken man; he saw a future Salvation Army soldier.

“Ken came through our doors looking for a meal,” says Lieutenant Gallagher. “He didn’t realize God had another plan for his life!”

Before coming to Greenville, North Carolina, Ken had everything—family, career, a home. But a series of poor decisions gradually unraveled the fabric of his life. His marriage and relationship with his two sons dissolved. Soon after, he lost his job, house, car, and eventually, his faith and hope.

It wasn’t until the second time he attempted to take his own life that he realized he needed a change.

“I was fighting a war against myself, and losing badly,” Ken says. “I knew I needed to get away and start over.”

He’d heard about a homeless shelter in Greenville where he could begin rebuilding his shattered life. Unbeknownst to Ken, God was working quietly in the background, preparing the way for a new path.

For the next 12 months, Ken called the shelter home, navigating each day one step at a time. Through persistence and hard work, he eventually got an apartment. Then his neighbor Buddy mentioned The Salvation Army’s Mission Station program, offering free breakfast several days a week. What began as a practical way to stretch his budget soon became something far more significant—a lifeline to community and purpose.

“Sometimes the smallest mercies are the ones that save us,” Ken reflects. “I went to Mission Station and found food, friendship, and acceptance. I also found hope.”

Ken became a familiar presence at Mission Station, not just as a recipient but as a contributor. God’s transformative work was becoming visible to everyone, except Ken himself. He wanted nothing to do with the God he blamed for his misfortunes.

“I was angry with God,” says Ken. “I thought He had abandoned me. He didn’t want me, so I didn’t want Him.”

Ken’s standoff with God continued until he needed a ride home from Mission Station.

“I invited Ken to worship and Bible study every time I saw him,” Lieutenant Gallagher recalls. “And every time, his answer was a firm ‘NO!’ Then one day, he needed a ride home, and I told him I couldn’t take him until after our men’s Bible study. He had some choice words for me but then sat quietly at the back of the room.”

To everyone’s surprise, Ken returned to Bible study the following week.

One year later, Ken’s transformation is remarkable. He attends every worship service and recently became a Salvation Army soldier. He rings bells joyfully at Christmas, bringing smiles to passersby. He chaperones for youth programs, volunteers at the thrift store, and helps organize the Christmas Center. No task is too big or too small; he tackles everything with the dedication of someone who has discovered his purpose.

“I finally recognized what was missing in my life all along—a relationship with God,” Ken explains. “During my darkest times, I was angry with everyone, especially God. I didn’t believe He would want me back after all my mistakes.”

Ken continues, “But through the genuine love and acceptance I found here, I learned He had been there all along. God never stopped loving me. I tried doing everything on my own, but that path leads nowhere. Now I know I’m never alone again.”

What seemed like rock bottom wasn’t the end of Ken’s story—it was the beginning of his journey. His life gives powerful testament that God never leaves us and that our greatest defeats can become the foundation for our most meaningful victories.
