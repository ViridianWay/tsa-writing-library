# The Salvation Army Responds to Devastating Texas Floods

*For real-time updates on The Salvation Army's EDS response in Texas and beyond, visit* [salarmyeds.org](https://www.salarmyeds.org).

As much of the country was preparing to celebrate Independence Day on July 4, more than 10 inches of rain fell in Kerr County, Texas over a period of fewer than 12 hours. This weather event produced an overflow from the Guadalupe River, leading to devastating flooding in the region. Within hours, the catastrophic floods were highly destructive, causing widespread damage and the confirmed loss of more than 100 lives across six counties.

In response, The Salvation Army immediately sprang into action, first by deploying a mobile kitchen at the request of local authorities followed by a rapid expansion of the comprehensive response. At the same time, Salvation Army units were serving in nearby San Angelo, where many areas were also under water and in dire need of support.

As within any Emergency Disaster Services (EDS) response, The Salvation Army coordinated its actions with local authorities, law enforcement, and partner agencies while aiming to meet human need in His name without discrimination. In the first 24 hours, nearly 1,000 meals and snacks were served to those in need, in addition to the distribution of blankets, cleanup kits, food boxes, and towels.

Major Phil Swyers, senior Kroc Center officer in Kerrville, estimates that nearly 1,000 first responders, representing several agencies, arrived in Kerrville within hours after the response was initiated.

“It has been a blessing for The Salvation Army to provide 24-hour support as they tirelessly work to help in our community. People have been grateful to receive a meal, drink, and a word of encouragement or prayer from our team.”

The Salvation Army’s scope of service also widened at the behest of local authorities. The Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM) formally requested that The Salvation Army host its location for a Volunteer Reception Center, the coordinated intake location for all volunteer and in-kind donations in Kerrville. This included a call center and dedicated phone hotline, staffed by TDEM volunteers, both of which play key roles in routing requests through appropriate channels.

As with any overarching EDS response, The Salvation Army’s ability to serve is enhanced by crucial partnerships, both in operations and funding. In the initial stages of the Texas flood response, partners included the Dallas Cowboys, Walmart, Sam’s Club, the Walmart Foundation, Kroger, the NFL Foundation, McDonalds, GrapeJuice of Kerrville, Scooters Coffee, the Texas Fire Walkers group, and many more, with additional expected in following days.

Major Swyers and others have regularly appeared on national broadcasts, helping to raise awareness, and the Graham Media Group and Gray Media partnered on an urgent donation drive to support the overall recovery, raising more than $100,000 toward The Salvation Army’s service efforts in the first 24 hours. Gray Media is on the air in more than 100 markets across the United States, and the combination of finances and awareness greatly aided the overall response.

“Graham Media Group is proud to partner with Gray in supporting The Salvation Army’s critical emergency disaster response in Texas,” said Catherine Badalamente, CEO of Graham Media Group. “As broadcasters, we have a responsibility to not only inform our communities about breaking news but to help them in times of crisis. The Salvation Army’s rapid response teams are providing essential services to flood victims, and we’re honored to contribute to these life-saving relief efforts during this devastating time.”

A crucial pillar of The Salvation Army’s EDS efforts is the calling to not only meet physical needs, but also emotional and spiritual needs of both survivors and first responders. Shortly after the initial response, seven dedicated emotional and spiritual care (ESC) officers deployed to the Kerrville area to provide much-needed support.

“The early days and hours after a disaster are typically filled with lots of practical things to take care of,” said Captain Jenifer Phillips, corps officer in Lufkin, Texas, and an ESC officer in Kerrville. “Survivors are busy with important decisions like, ‘How are my loved ones? Where will we sleep tonight? When will the power come back on?’ or ‘Where will the next meal come from?’ They have so many things to deal with. Once some of those immediate needs are met, that is often when the emotional impact of a crisis is first experienced.”

In addition to providing food and supplies, ESC officers are consistently available, both to provide counsel and prayer, but also to act as sounding boards for those who may just need someone to speak with during a difficult time.

“More times than not, people who have experienced crisis and disaster welcome the opportunity to talk with someone. They will readily share their personal situation and how they have been affected,” Captain Phillips said. “It is our job to listen, offer a prayer, and let them know that God loves them, and that The Salvation Army loves them and is here to provide support and help, even in the darkest of times.”

As of late of July, The Salvation Army served 6,563 hot meals, 43,331 drinks, and 46,128 snacks, provided 2,670 emotional and spiritual care contacts, and benefited from more than 6,500 service hours from dedicated individuals. The response will only continue to grow in the coming days, and The Salvation Army will be on the scene, helping others in Jesus’ name, well beyond when others may turn their attention elsewhere.

“The Salvation Army has worked in this community for many years,” said Major Swyers. “And we are uniquely positioned to step forward and partner with the county and city in this way.” “

Our ministry is motivated by the love of God,” Captain Phillips said. “We want to share that with those we encounter, even on what could very well be the hardest day of their lives.”
