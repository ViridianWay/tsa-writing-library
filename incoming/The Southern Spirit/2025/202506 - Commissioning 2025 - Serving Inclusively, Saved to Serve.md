## “Serving Inclusively”

Following upbeat preliminary selections by the NCB and the Southern Staff Songsters (SSS), Lt. Colonel Mark Israel, territorial program secretary, began the [Saturday morning session at Commissioning 2025](https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/stories/commissioning-2025-serving-inclusively-saved-to-serve/) saying, “Each year when we join together for a commissioning event, we’re blessed to celebrate the ordination and commissioning of the current session coming out of the EBC. Another priority of our time on these weekends is to offer all who attend the opportunity to go deeper into the focus that we have as a territory.” 

As this year’s focus is SERVE, he explained, all delegates would have the opportunity that afternoon to go out and serve in the local community. “We realize this may be out of your comfort zone, but we are Salvationists. So, we ask that you step out in faith and just watch how the Spirit will use us.” 

This announcement was followed by a recognition of the NCB on their celebration of 100 years of service through music ministry. On behalf of the territory, Nick Simmons-Smith, territorial music & creative arts education secretary, presented the NCB with a brand-new set of stand banners to commemorate the achievement. 

Commissioner Kelly Igleheart announced, “We are honored and so proud to have this band in our territory. And the way that you have traveled the world playing Jesus and impacting the global Salvation Army for the Kingdom. We are honored and so proud.” 

In a blessing over the group, he prayed, “This band is not put together just for the enjoyment of the group and for a beautiful melody to your ears. This band was put together for worship, for service, and for love.” 

The NCB then played “Semper Fidelis,” which means “always faithful,” thanking God for His faithfulness and declaring through song that they will continue to use their talents in service of the Lord.

Yet another celebration followed, as the territory announced the formal opening of a new Salvation Army corps. 

“In 2018, a small but faithful outpost took root in Waldorf, Maryland,” Commissioner Kelly explained. “It began without fanfare, but with quiet acts of service. Planting seeds of hope in the hearts and homes throughout the community in that area. And what started as a humble beginning soon became a beacon of hope.” 

The original outpost grew over seven years under the faithful leadership of Sergeants Jonathan and Rebecca Palpan. After presenting Potomac Divisional Leaders Lt. Colonels Allan and Fiona Hoffer with a newly made flag for the corps, Commissioner Kelly surprised the Palpans by reinstating them as active Salvation Army officers with the rank of lieutenant. 

“What a beautiful case of people who, regardless of rank, or position, or post, come faithfully to serve,” Commissioner Kelly said before praying a prayer of blessing over Lieutenants Palpan and their continued ministry in Waldorf. 

TAM and the SSS then presented a stirring musical request through “If Your Presence” for the Holy Spirit to fill all those present and to empower them to serve in God’s name. 

Special guest Commissioner Shelley Hill brought a poignant message, entreating the Southern Territory to live out the inclusivity of Christ in their service. “Instead of creating barriers that keep people away or out, let’s be followers of Jesus who seek to build beautiful bridges that include and welcome all.” 

Chief Secretary Colonel Deborah Sedlar then urged those present to truly take to heart Commissioner Shelley’s call to be like Jesus. “Today we’re going to put the Word of God into action because of what’s taken place with us.” 

“This is a call to action,” she continued. “It’s time to get up and do something. We are people of the King. We are saved, and we are called to serve the Almighty.” 

Delegates were then encouraged to live out that calling by participating in afternoon outreach events following a fellowship lunch.

## “Saved to Serve”

Salvationists are “Saved to Serve.” That slogan represents the soul-saving power of Jesus Christ and the calling of The Salvation Army to serve others in His name without discrimination. This was also the theme of the [Saturday evening session](https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/stories/commissioning-2025-serving-inclusively-saved-to-serve/) , with Emily Horton of the Kentucky-Tennessee Division opening the service by referencing Mark 10 and God’s calling.

“Since its earliest days, The Salvation Army has lived out these values, embracing the gifts and talents of young people and empowering them to take their place in the mission of the Kingdom,” Horton said. “That mission that we all wear so proudly on our uniforms, telling the world that we are ‘Saved to Serve’ for the salvation of the world.”

What transpired from that point was a moving service of worship, learning, and praise. transMission accompanied worship throughout the evening, leading the singing of powerful anthems including “My Testimony,” “Christ Be Magnified,” and “The Sending.” They were joined by members of TAM for “Set a Fire,” with Lt. Gessica Pierre, keynote speaker and corps officer in Burlington, North Carolina, describing the presentation as “a beautiful demonstration of what the Holy Spirit can do with young lives when we surrender to Him with no restrictions and no reservations.”

Young adults were a central focus throughout the evening, with Commissioner Kelly Igleheart presiding over the installation of a new Territorial Youth Sergeant Major. Danielle Delaney, who is the divisional Christian education director for the Potomac Division, will now serve in a territory-wide capacity as a key figure and representative of young people. Commissioner Kelly bestowed praise on her ever-present work in Potomac while also encouraging prayers and support for her future service.

“Lord, I thank you for all those lives who have poured into Danielle over these years and the lives she now pours into,” Commissioner Kelly said. “I pray that you would give her wisdom, courage, and discernment—a passion for these, our young people. I pray that she would flourish in this new appointment and assignment and that young people and their lives would be enriched because Danielle sees, hears, and acts on their behalf.”

Lt. Pierre spoke on Matthew 25, encouraging attendees and clearly illustrating the responsibility that comes with service. “Being a child of God is the highest blessing, but with every blessing and with every privilege comes responsibility.” She continued, “God will always call us to Himself first and then to others immediately after. We’re saved to serve… Service is the responsibility that is attached to the blessing of being a child of God.”

She presented a clear challenge to do what is necessary to walk in step with Jesus Christ with integrity, paving the way for His impact to manifest in the lives of others. “If you want to be great, serve. Friends, you are blessed to be a blessing. You have been given all of these gifts. We’ve seen it all weekend. All these talents, for the betterment of the Kingdom and the betterment of others.”

Interstitial videos were woven throughout the program, with Ashley Escobar, territorial ministry specialist for ministry to women, interviewing Major Zach Bell, Tameka Douglas, Major Georgia Henderson, Major David Waite, and Cadet Danielle Farrington. Each of the five representatives served previously as members of the Salvationist Service Corps (SSC), and the close of Saturday night’s meeting was a high-energy “send-off” for the 2025 teams.

For nearly 60 years, SSC teams have ministered globally, and three teams of young adults, with 18 individuals in total, will serve this summer in Alaska, Chile, and Scotland. The closing song, “The World for God,” led by transMission, was an apt anthem, encouraging all with the words of “I give my heart, I’ll do my part, the world for God.”

Major Matt Satterlee, territorial youth secretary, put into focus the power of young people in the future of the Kingdom and The Salvation Army. “With all these years of youth ministry, I can tell you that there is a deep hunger there. The Lord is moving in this next generation in ways that I don’t think any of us could anticipate. There is a deep spiritual movement in those coming behind us.”

He also spoke on the role all can play to support young people while acknowledging they are “not the Church of tomorrow, but the Church of today.”

“Let us let them lead,” he said. “Let us guide them as they go. Let us mentor them. Let us coach them. Let us lead them. And The Salvation Army will be taken care of. And the Church will be taken care of. And the Kingdom of God will be taken care of.”
