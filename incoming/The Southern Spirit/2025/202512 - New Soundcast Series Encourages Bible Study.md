Beginning December 7, Words of Life launches a new series exploring the transformative impact of in-depth Bible study on faith and daily living.

The series brings together Lt. Colonel Melody Davis, Major Claudia Roseno, Caleb Louden, Chris Hofer, and Bernie Dake to discuss how Bible study has impacted each of them personally. In the opening episode, the panel examines how the biblical canon came to be, offering listeners clear, accessible context for the formation of the scriptures we read today. Their conversation also delves into key moments within the Word of God, unpacking the historical and cultural background that enriches our understanding of biblical texts.

Throughout the discussion, each panelist reflects on personal “aha” moments discovered through disciplined study — pivotal insights that have shaped their spiritual journeys and strengthened their individual walks with God. Their testimonies underscore a central theme of the series: intentional, consistent engagement with Scripture can deepen understanding, foster spiritual growth, and bring renewed clarity to God’s will for our lives.

As we approach a new year, Words of Life invites listeners to commit to cultivating a habit of Bible study in 2026. Each episode in the series includes curated links to trusted study tools, devotionals, and recommended reading to support individuals at every stage of their spiritual walk. Whether you are beginning your study journey or seeking to enrich long-standing practices, these resources are designed to encourage, equip, and inspire.
