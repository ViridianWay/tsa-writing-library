For Ursula Arello, attending the University of Tennessee Homecoming football game against Mississippi State on November 9 with her daughter turned out to be more than just a chance to cheer for the Volunteers. It became a heartfelt reminder of her family's legacy of generosity, gratitude, and faith—all sparked by an unexpected encounter at a Salvation Army Red Kettle.

As Arello and her daughter approached Neyland Stadium, the iconic sound of a bell ringing caught her attention. Standing by the familiar Red Kettle was Major Cam Henderson, area commander of The Salvation Army in Knoxville. After donating digitally via QR code, Arello found herself engaged in conversation with Major Henderson, who kindly inquired about her connection to The Salvation Army.

What followed was a deeply personal story that has shaped Arello’s life—and now, Major Henderson’s mission. She shared how her late grandfather, a destitute Italian immigrant toddler around 1910, was saved by The Salvation Army. Severely undernourished and suspected of having pneumonia, her grandfather faced bleak odds until The Salvation Army coordinated his medical care and placement in foster care.

> “The Salvation Army didn’t just save his life,” Arello says. “They gave him a future—and gave me and my family a reason to always support the kettles.”

Moved by her words, Major Henderson offered a prayer of gratitude and blessing, turning an ordinary game day moment into a profound spiritual experience.

“I never expected that kind of outreach and care at a football game,” Arello shares. “Major Henderson’s prayer was so thoughtful and poignant. It reminded me that The Salvation Army’s mission is about more than meeting physical needs—it’s about offering hope and compassion at every opportunity.”

For Major Henderson, this encounter was a reminder of why The Salvation Army exists. “Hearing stories like Ms. Arello’s is humbling,” he says. “It’s a testament to the enduring impact of love, care, and faith in action.”

Arello’s story underscores the importance of the mission of The Salvation Army, focusing on providing meals, shelter, and hope to those in need, and continuing to impact lives for more than a century.
