The Salvation Army’s *Words of Life* podcast recently welcomed Dr. Zach Clinton for a six-part series exploring faith, mental health, and the unique challenges facing men today. Dr. Clinton, a licensed professional counselor, serves as vice president of the American Association of Christian Counselors, hosts the *Built Different* podcast, and leads the Ignite Men’s Impact Weekend, an annual gathering of nearly 10,000 men in Virginia. 

Dr. Clinton was raised in a Christian home with parents who modeled faith, love, and stability. But he admits that for years he had “knowledge of Jesus” without truly knowing Him personally. At age 14, a chapel service led by evangelist Clayton King awakened him to the reality that faith cannot be inherited — it must be personal. That moment became the foundation of his salvation story and the beginning of his journey into ministry and counseling. 

Dr. Clinton’s podcast, *Built Different*, was born out of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 lockdowns. Originally launched as a men’s series called *Battle Cry*, it was designed to encourage men who were struggling with isolation. Over time, its reach expanded to include women and the next generation, shifting the focus toward sharing powerful testimonies. 

“We are overcomers because of the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony,” Dr. Clinton declares, referencing Revelation 12:11. Each episode highlights stories of athletes, ministry leaders, counselors, and everyday people who testify to how God has worked in their lives, even in seasons of hardship. The conversations often weave together themes of faith and mental health, offering listeners both spiritual encouragement and practical wisdom. 

Too often, Dr. Clinton notes, Western culture equates ministry with being on a stage or holding a microphone. But biblically, the pulpit was never meant to be a platform for performance — it was an altar of surrender. “Ministry is not about being on a stage,” he says. “It’s about posturing our hearts in surrender to Jesus, even in the midst of hardship.” 

Dr. Clinton fully believes that everyday Christians, especially those in secular workplaces, can often make the greatest impact. Ministry is not limited to pastors and missionaries; it happens wherever believers live out their faith with authenticity and humility. 

In discussing his work with Ignite Men’s Ministry, Dr. Clinton outlines some of the core struggles men face in today’s culture: 

1. *Pressure –* Men often carry the overwhelming expectation to provide for their families, protect their loved ones, and constantly perform at the highest level in every area of life. While these roles are noble, the relentless pressure to live up to them can slowly chip away at a man’s spirit, leaving him exhausted, isolated, and hesitant to admit when the burden feels too heavy. Over time, this silent struggle often results in burnout, strained relationships, and even a diminished faith. Dr. Clinton emphasizes that seeking help in these moments is not a sign of weakness, but rather a profound act of wisdom and humility, an acknowledgment that God never designed us to walk through life alone but to lean on Him and the community He has given us. 
2. *Preoccupation –* Technology and the constant lure of instant gratification have left many men distracted and disconnected from what truly matters. With just a swipe or a click, phones, social media, and endless digital outlets provide quick dopamine hits that temporarily satisfy but never truly fulfill. Over time, this cycle of chasing shallow rewards pulls men away from the richness of deeper relationships, whether with God, family, or friends. Instead of being fully present in the moment, many find themselves caught in a loop of constant scrolling, comparison, and noise, leaving little room for genuine connection, spiritual growth, or the quiet stillness where God’s voice is heard. 
3. *People (or lack thereof) –* Perhaps most concerning is the loneliness epidemic. Studies show that a significant percentage of men do not have even one trusted friend with whom they can share their struggles. At a certain age, people can even struggle to make friends. The absence of authentic connection can drive men toward destructive outlets. 

Among those destructive outlets, pornography stands out as a pervasive issue. Dr. Clinton shares candidly about his own battle with pornography as a teenager, describing it as a “silent killer” fueled by secrecy, accessibility, and shame. Left unchecked, it can fuel addiction and further isolate men. He believes this contributes directly to rising rates of anxiety, depression, and even suicide among men. He emphasizes that healing comes through bringing struggles into the light, confessing them, and asking for help. 

“While there is a such thing as toxic masculinity, there is nothing toxic about being a man,” Dr. Clinton states. Toxic behavior from ungodly men has often left godly men wondering where they fit in with society today. 

While men today face immense pressures and temptations, Dr. Clinton’s message is that freedom and healing are possible through Christ and through authentic community. His ministry — whether through counseling, Ignite Men’s Weekend, or *Built Different* — is committed to helping men step out of isolation, surrender their burdens, and experience the power of God’s redemption.
