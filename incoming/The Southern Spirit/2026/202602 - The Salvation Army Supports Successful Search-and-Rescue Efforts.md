Over the second weekend in January 2026, The Salvation Army of Chickasha, Oklahoma provided support during a search-and-rescue operation for a 12-year-old boy who had been reported missing since January 2. As the search stretched on, the entire community joined in prayer, hoping for the child’s safe return.

At the request of local emergency management, The Salvation Army responded by providing on-site support and a ministry of presence for first responders involved in search efforts. Salvation Army personnel served hot meals throughout the day along with snacks, beverages, and emotional and spiritual care for those working tirelessly in challenging conditions.

“While we never hope to put our emergency disaster training into action, we are grateful to be prepared when the moment arises,” says Lieutenant Crystal McFarland, Chickasha corps officer. “It is an honor to care for our first responders, both physically and spiritually, after days of relentless searching for a missing child in our community.”

The search concluded with joyful news — the child was found alive and safe.

The Salvation Army remains committed to serving our communities during times of crisis and stands ready to support residents and emergency personnel as needed.
