The Atlanta Peachcrest Corps recently celebrated half a century of legacy, love, and God’s faithfulness. As of October 2025, the corps has successfully ministered through their youth afterschool corps and community ministries for 50 years.

Celebrations commenced Friday, October 24, with a fundraising dinner featuring and honoring former NFL player Julius Williams. Williams grew up in the Glenwood community, where his mother still lives, where he participated in The Salvation Army’s afterschool programs.

“The Salvation Army saved my life!” Williams declared. “And that’s why I devote myself and my team to giving back to youth in this same community.” Williams’ moving testimony elicited many tears and motivated those present to give generously to the corps’ continuing efforts to disciple the next generation through youth programs.

Special weekend guests and former Peachcrest Corps officers Majors Henry and Benita Morris gave an inspiring word, and Corps Sergeant Major (CSM) Ronald White performed an original dance. The presence and support of many community leaders was a wonderful blessing, particularly that of Super District Commissioner Dr. Ladena Bolton and other Board of Education and community dignitaries.

On Saturday, October 25, the corps paused celebrations to support Majors Paul and Barbara Mason, fellow corps members, in the service for the Promotion to Glory of their brother, Major Noel Mason. “Peachcrest Corps is a family, and we are here for each other,” Peachcrest Corps Officer Captain Jamaal Ellis says of the decision to join the larger surrounding Salvation Army community for the day.

A “Praise Party” on Sunday rounded out the weekend celebrations. Starting with preliminary rhythmic “island flavored” brass and stringed music, everyone was immediately on their feet praising God. A group of former Peachcrest Corps officers, including Commissioners Willis and Barbara Howell, Majors Henry and Benita Morris, Majors Ted and Pamela Morris, and Sharon Bowman, marched down the aisle as the corps celebrated the foundation these and many others labored to build, leading to this successful and flourishing ministry.

During the service, Divisional CSM Shirley Dunlap gave a moving tribute to the late YPSM (Young People’s Sergeant Major) Cherwanda Williams. Assistant Corps Officers Captains Cornelius and Noldine Walton then led the offering and a congregational song. Area Commander Major Stacie McWilliams later shared a greeting and congratulations from Georgia Divisional Headquarters on completing 50 years of successful youth ministry.

Captains Jamaal and Tamarique Ellis, current officers of the Peachcrest Corps, then performed the enrollment of Junior Soldier Thunder Williams. Major Henry Morris prayed over this newest corps member, sharing that Thunder’s enrollment marks the third generation of his family’s faithful membership at the corps.

Afterward, the Peachcrest Dazzling Divine Dancers, under the leadership of Summer White, received a standing ovation for their exceptional performance.

Visiting guests included the divisional commanders from Eastern & Western Jamaica, Majors Marlene Agyemang and Major Mark Kellman, Major Denny Hewitt, Captain Shimei Hewitt, local officers Majors Wilfred and Amy Samuel, and Majors Paul and Barbara Mason, all taking part in the celebration through music ministry.

In bringing the morning’s message, Commissioner Willis Howell left the congregation with the challenge to continue to “Make Defining Moments” for many years to come.

The corps concluded the service by celebrating the legacy of those who paved the way for this incredible milestone celebration, including Majors Allan and Marjorie Wiltshire, Mrs. Carmen Levy, and Mrs. Varley Simons. The congregation gave resounding applause and a standing ovation for Major Grace Cumberbatch, honoring her extreme dedication over the years in youth and adult corps ministries, outreach, encouragement, teaching, sacrifice, and so much more.

A beautiful lunch followed, prepared by corps members Darlene Backus, Vickie Kelley, and many other volunteers. Additionally, a representative from the Dekalb County Commissioner’s office presented a proclamation to declare the day “Salvation Army Day.”

God has been faithful for 50 years, and He has wonderful things in store for the future!
