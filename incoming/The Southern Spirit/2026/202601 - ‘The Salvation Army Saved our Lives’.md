Life is fine now for J.R. McDaniel, but 35 years ago, his family was in crisis. His dad, a former pastor, fell into alcoholism and became a constant threat to his wife, Phyllis, and two sons, J.R. and C.J, ages 10 and 9, respectively. Phyllis finally took her boys and moved to a shelter in Lufkin, Texas.

They attended a few churches, and some of J.R.’s favorite times were at Christian summer camps. At one special camp, he even gave his heart to the Lord.

“My times at those summer camps made all the difference in the world to me,” J.R. recalls.

When they could move into a house, they found one directly across the street from The Salvation Army’s Lufkin Corps. They had already been receiving aid from The Salvation Army to help them get back on their feet, and having the corps so close by was a natural convenience, allowing the two boys and their mom to attend corps activities full time.

“We were regular people in a crazy, scary moment,” says J.R. of their transition from fear and abuse to a life of peace and security. “The Army clothed, fed, and nourished us. I can’t imagine what our lives would have been like without The Salvation Army.”

For all the negative aspects his dad represented in the boy’s life, J.R.’s mom was the opposite, imparting “a rock-solid faith” on her sons through their formative years.

“But there comes a point where you have to stop living on your mother’s faith, and begin living yours,” J.R. says. He and C.J. discovered that living a Christian life was not just for Sundays. The brothers have remained close over the years, getting matching tattoos with Philippians 4:13 on one side of their wrist and a Superman “S” on the other. Besides their apparent love of the Man of Steel, the underlying message of the double-tattoos reminds them: *“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”*

Following grade school, J.R. attended college, first at Angelina Junior College in Lufkin, then completed his Bachelor of Science in business and finance at Stephen F. Austin University in nearby Nacogdoches, Texas. He now works as a financial advisor and senior vice-president at Regions Investment Solutions in Lufkin. Regions encourages community involvement for their employees, so J.R.’s work within the local Army’s advisory board is most welcome to all concerned.

“I was attending the ‘Leadership Lufkin’ program in 2017, and one of our speakers was Captain Jason Moore (Lufkin corps officer at the time, now with the rank of Major),” J.R. says. “The captain invited me to the advisory board meeting, and that’s how I joined, eventually becoming chairperson. These days I serve on the PR/Development Committee.”

His fund-raising efforts include selling tables each year for the corps’ annual meeting and Christmas season efforts. J.R., his wife, Joanna, and their children are active volunteers for the corps, including annual meetings, distributions, and ringing the bell at Christmas kettles.

Captains Cavon and Jenifer Phillips, the current Lufkin corps officers, consider J.R. and his family more than just Salvation Army supporters and an advisory board member — they have become close friends and prayer partners.

“J.R. is a man of God first,” Captain Jenifer explains. “He loves Jesus, and that’s evident in how he lives his life. He and Joanna are teaching their children the best ways to serve God.

“As a board member, he always shows a willingness to give back and is one of the first to say ‘yes’ to anything asked of him to benefit the Lufkin Corps. He is also our best ‘board recruiter,’ constantly seeking out other potential board members. In our two counties of service, J.R. is always ‘behind the Red Shield,’ sharing the mission and ministry of The Salvation Army to the public.”

Four present board members are personal friends of J.R. and have come on board because of that connection. “The captains [Phillips] kid me, asking me if I have any more friends out there who might be potential advisory board leaders!” he adds, laughing.

This testimony cannot end without an update on J.R.’s father.

“In 2002, my dad and I reconnected, and he came back to Christ, living clean and sober for the last decade of his life,” J.R. shares. “In his own way he tried to make things right.”

Despite his difficult relationship with his father, J.R. chooses to dwell on the positives moving forward: “Losing him to cancer at age 59 makes me reevaluate my own life,” J.R. admits. “If today were my last day on this planet, I’d want to know what kind of impact I’ve made in my life and what example I have left for my kids.

“Pursuing Christ is what matters in life!”
