# The Stations Occupied by the Mission

_From "How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel" by William Booth_

---

We now proceed to describe THE STATIONS OCCUPIED BY THE MISSION, And commence with the central one, WHITECHAPEL.

This is our mother station. Here, as we have already remarked, the work was commenced. A tent was our first meeting place, but being an old one, and rough weather coming unexpectedly, it was torn to pieces, and we had to seek shelter elsewhere. The only place we could obtain for either love or money, was

A DANCING ROOM.

and this only on the Sabbath. It was a miserable affair, seating only some 350 people, while for it we had to pay one pound per week, finding our own forms; and some of our brethren had to come in their weekday clothes early on the Sabbath morning to move them in. The proprietor was a photographer doing a large trade on the Sabbath. His customers had to pass through a room which was open to the hall, forming a sort of gallery, in order to reach the studio, and often on their way up and down, they would pause and listen to us preaching below. Meanwhile, the wife would be sitting in the front room colouring and getting up the pictures. We often talked to her about God and eternity, and she frequently listened to the preaching, but she belonged to the class which assent to all that is said, and go quietly on in their sins.

During the early part of the occupation of this dancing academy, we had no place for week-night meetings. Fortunately, the season was unusually fine, and during the long autumn nights, we held meetings in the open-air; commencing at seven and continuing until late in the evening; announcing at the close that we should be glad to speak to any who were anxious to save their souls; and after pronouncing the benediction, we went in among the crowd and spoke personally to them of Jesus. There we had often the privilege of seeing tears of penitence, and pointing anxious souls to the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world.

As the winter approached and the nights grew cold, an indoor station became a necessity, and a room was taken in Three Colts Lane, Bethnal Green. Meetings here were continued as afterwards described, and also about this time, in the ragged church, Mile End New Town, at Stepney, and at Satchwell Street, Bethnal Green. At each place souls found Christ. At the one last named, among others was

A WANDERER FROM THE FOLD.

After an address one evening, he cried out in much distress for God to save him. He was a drunkard, knew his Bible, and a long time back walked in the way of peace. The Lord heard his cry, and pardoned his sin. Months afterwards we stood by his deathbed, and heard his confident assurance that his feet were on the Rock. He died in the faith. Shortly after his conversion, his wife, son, and daughter were brought to God, and remain with us to this day.

Other places were afterwards occupied in Whitechapel, one of which was

A COVERED SKITTLE GROUND,

attached to a low public house. A few boards placed over the frame on which the nine pins were fixed on the week day, served as a platform, and thrusting the bagatelle table into a passage, out of sight, we preached Christ to whomsoever would come to hear. At the last service held in this place there were twelve anxious souls.

About this time we occupied a shop on week nights to the front of the Whitechapel Road, and although a miserable place for Mission work, the following was one among other interesting incidents connected with it.

PRECIOUS GRAIN GATHERED.

One evening, while holding a useful service in the open air near by, a policeman ordered us away. We left at once, after inviting the people to go with us to the shop, which many did. Among others who followed us was a young woman, to whose heart the word came that evening with great power. So deeply was she convicted, that before she left she confessed herself a sinner, and sought rest in Jesus. She at once untied with us, and for a season walked happily in the ways of the Lord. A few months afterwards, a brother, who had been away in the army, returned home, and was much annoyed to find his sister professing to be a Christian. He ridiculed her religion, and after a while prevailed on her to accompany him to the theatre. She went, but conscience smote her, and she had not a moment's peace until the sin was confessed and forgiven. From that hour she walked consistently, attending all the meetings, but especially those in the open air. Her mother said that she would get up from bed to go into the Mile End Road as long as she could possibly walk as far; and when her strength failed, and she was obliged to go into the hospital, she wrote letters expressive of the deep interest she continued to feel in those services, which had been instrumental in leading her feet into the ways of righteousness.

Through a long illness, in deep poverty, surrounded by relatives who had no sympathy with religion, did this young disciple, picked up in the Mile End Road, hold on to Jesus, and adorn his glorious doctrine. As the deadly malady increased, her faith grew brighter. To those who visited her she said, "I am quite ready — all is well. 'Thy will be done.'" And in this state of mind, "waiting," as she expressed it, "till her time came," she passed triumphant home; another precious grain gathered into the heavenly garner through the instrumentality of street preaching.

THE EFFINGHAM, NOW THE EAST LONDON THEATRE.

About this time our way opened to take this theatre for Sabbath evening services. It was then a dingy, dirty place, visited only by the lowest and roughest classes. Most of our friends were opposed to our taking it; they argued that it had been tried again and again and had not succeeded, and that in it we should certainly fail to secure congregations. However, we resolved to try, and from the commencement succeeded most blessedly. One of the first services is thus described in one of a series of papers published at the time, in the Nonconformist newspaper, under the heading of

IRREGULAR RELIGIOUS AGENCIES.

> To visit this theatre on a week-day evening, and to note the crowded, noisy assemblage; the coatless forms; the hardened, brutalised features; the bitter oath or disgusting jest, could scarcely fail to awaken a misgiving as to the real character of a Sunday evening service in such a place; nevertheless, we determined upon the experiment of a visit.
> 
> Sunday evening in Whitechapel Road forms a scene which the pen of a Dickens alone could properly describe. Crowded public-houses, groups of men and boys returning from Victoria Park, scores of tawdrily attired girls shouting and chasing each other across the road-way, empty hearses; returning from Bow Cemetery, bare-headed women from Whitechapel slums, unwashed costermongers, and a hundred other salient features, alike force themselves on our attention as we stand in front of the Ellingham Theatre. It is half-past six, and the service does not commence until seven, yet there are some half-dozen quiet-looking men and women waiting, with exemplary patience, for the opening of the doors. To and fro surges the human sea past the theatre. A few individuals go into the public-house attached to the building, others stop to look at the pictorial announcements of the new play to be produced on Monday night, but the great mass hurry steadily onward. A noisy shooting of bolts, a heavy creaking sound, and at last the doors are opened. In rushes the little crowd, down a dark, narrow, confined passage, leading to one of the dingiest and gloomiest places of amusement to be found, perhaps, in all Loudon. There is nothing very elevated or refined here. The walls are black with dirt, and gaudy tinselled ornaments half-hidden with layers of dust, and the gaslights so few in number as to give a extremely cheerless and dispiriting look to the whole place. The stage — not a very large one — is fitted up with scenery and wings representing the interior of some impossible mansion; while, for the use of the preacher and his colleagues, a white and green "property" table, ornamented with plenty of Dutch metal, with chairs to match, have been placed in front of the footlights. A series of rickety steps, covered with green cloth, furnish a ready means of communication between the stage and the audience. Whilst we have been taking in these details. the building has been filling rapidly. The gallery is already thronged with a motley assemblage, including a large proportion of the "rough" element. The pit is equally full, but here the working men and their families are decidedly in the majority. There are very few of the shopkeeping class present; the place is far too low, too vulgar for them; so the labouring people and the roughs have it — much to their satisfaction — all to themselves. It is astonishing how quiet and peaceable they are. There is no one, except a stray official, to maintain order; yet here are nearly two thousand people, belonging to the poorest and least educated class, behaving in a manner which would reflect the highest credit upon the most respectable congregation that ever attended a regular place of worship. Surely there is good soil here. Very many have purchased copies of the penny hymn-book sold at the doors, but of Bibles scarcely one is to be seen. Bibles are rarities in Whitechapel homes, The pawnbroker and publican can best tell us why.
> 
> Precisely at seven, Mr. Booth made his appearance in front of the foot-lights, and gave out the well-known hymn commencing,
> 
> "There is a better world, they say,"
> 
> which was sung with an intensity and vigour which would have somewhat startled those accustomed only to the slow-measured Gregorian chants or dreamy tunes now so fashionable in most places of worship. Everybody seemed to join in the singing. They gloried in it, as if in so doing they for the moment forgot all the sorrows, cares, and woes of their daily life. Certainly, it was a strange sight; this vast multitude of hard-featured men and women in humble attire, in their working coats and in their tattered shawls, standing up amid all the dingy, tawdry tinseled surroundings, to sing of the bettor world where "music fills the balmy air," and "angels with bright wings," and "harps of gold," and "mansions fair," hold out the rich and glorious promise of future happiness. As the hymn proceeded, the strain became more and more earnest, until the lines —
> 
> " We may be cleansed from every stain,
> We may be crowned with bliss again,
> And in that land of pleasure reign,"
> 
> were reached, when it became almost pathetic in the emphasis bestowed upon it. The singers evidently felt what they sang, and as they reluctantly resumed their seats, a happier expression seemed to light up the broad sea of pale and careworn features which were turned with ardent, longing gaze towards the preacher and his colleagues. A short prayer followed, after which another hymn, "The voice of Wisdom cries, Be in time," was sung; and then came the usual chapter from the Bible. Mr. Booth employed very simple language in his comments upon each verse read by him, and several times, as if he was afraid his hearers would forget it. He told them that the devil was continually angling for man's soul — that he offered us wealth, pleasure, food, and every possible happiness on earth, if we would but serve him; while God, on the contrary, promised us eternal happiness hereafter. It was curious to note the intense, almost painful, degree of eagerness with which every utterance of the speaker was listened to. The crowd seemed fearful of losing even a word. Another hymn, sung with redoubled fervour, and then the sermon commenced. In an impassioned discourse, the preacher bade his hearers come forth from among the wicked and be saved. He spoke of God's mercy and man's ingratitude, and declared that God was compelled to be unmerciful to the wicked unless they repented; that He could not help it if they refused to listen to Him. He told his hearers of their faults, of their vices, and threatened them with all the terrors of eternal punishment unless they repented them of their sins. He spoke of the happiness experienced by the converted, and described how in all our troubles, in all our cares, Jesus was an ever-ready Friend, affording peace and consolation to all who believed in Him. He also told them of a poor man, a pauper, dying in a cold and desolate room, with no one near him to moisten his dry, parched lips, or to bathe his clammy brow. Yet, although abandoned by man, he was not deserted by God. Angels hovered around his deathbed, irradiating it with their glory, and bore his soul, as it emerged from its senseless cell of clay, to the bright and glorious shores of heaven. And when the poor man again opened his eyes, and beheld the grand and beautiful mansions, the crowds of saints clad in their robes of white, and with their harps of gold, and heard the eternal song of rejoicing ascending to the great white throne of God the Father, he could scarcely believe himself. He, the poor outcast, who had dared to rely on the mercy of his Redeemer, actually in Heaven! Impossible! But it was true. And how light seemed all his earthly trials, how paltry became all his earthly cares, how slight the weight of his cross, when his reward was a crown of happiness like to this! And as the speaker described the picture of the poor man in heaven, breathless silence pervaded the ranks of his hearers. You might see great brawny-limbed roughs endeavouring, but in vain, to look unconcerned; while, behind them, thin, gaunt-featured mechanics, made of less stubborn material, scarcely attempted to restrain the tears which glistened in their sunken eyes. Everybody seemed more or less affected. Here and there women were sobbing loudly, while others were looking with a stranger rapt gaze at the speaker. It was a wonderful influence,-that possessed by the preacher over his hearers. Very unconventional in style, no doubt, it enabled him to reach the hearts of hundreds of those for whom the prison and the convicts' settlement have no terrors, of whom even the police stand in fear. It is a rough-and-ready style of preaching but then the preacher has to do with rough-and-ready minds, upon which the subtleties of a refined discourse would be lost. If any proof of the effectiveness of Mr. Booth's preaching were required, it was afforded by the earnestness with which his hearers listened to the moral deduced by him from his text, in which he implored them, first, to leave their sins; second, to leave them at once, that night; and third, to come to Christ. Not a word that was uttered by him could be misunderstood; not a doctrine was propounded which was beyond the comprehension of those to whom it was addressed. We might dispute the speaker's taste in some matters, we might differ from some of his theological views, but his hearers were in nowise disposed to be critical. They listened to him with an amount of respect, attention, even eagerness, which conclusively demonstrated his mastery over their natures, his knowledge of their feelings, and the truth of his interpretation of their aspirations. There was no sign of impatience during the sermon. There was too much dramatic action, too much anecdotal matter, to admit of its being considered "dull;" and when it terminated scarcely a person left his seat. Indeed, some appeared to consider it too short, although the discourse had occupied fully an hour in its delivery! The hymn which followed —
> 
> "Just as I am, without one plea,
> But that Thy blood was shed for me
> And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee
> Oh! Lamb of God, I come,"
> 
> was sung with much feeling. Harmony there was little, noise there was plenty of, but, after all, why should we cavil at these trifles? Everybody wanted to sing, whether they possessed tuneful voices or not, and, where the will exists, let us not too sharply criticise the way in which it is developed. No sooner was the hymn over, than the numerous helpers whom Mr. Booth has gathered round him, and who belong almost exclusively to the poorer classes, began personally visiting all present, affectionately entreating them to join the band of believers in Christ's mercy. Nor were their efforts unsuccessful. Not a few went on to the stage and knelt in silent prayer. This continued for more than an hour, during which various prayers were offered up and several hymns sung. The dispersal of the audience was effected very slowly, and even so late as ten o'clock there were between two and three hundred people in the building but from first to last there was not the least interruption, not the shadow of an attempt at disorder. Surely this is something to be thankful for; the olive-branch which tells us that ground has been discovered at last, and that there is hope in the future for those engaged in the good and praiseworthy work of evangelising East London.

For upwards of three years the services were continued in this Theatre and we believe that only eternity will reveal the good done within its walls. Not only did multitudes hear the word, but we believe we do not exaggerate when we say that in it thousands were convicted of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. And what is better still, we have every reason to conclude that numbers were led to a saving acquaintance with our Saviour King. We are sure the following triumphs of saving once will be read with great interest, and they are only sample cases of a great number.

CONVERSION OF A PROFESSED ATHEIST.

As we were passing from seat to seat in this Theatre, some months ago, one of our helpers said, "Will you speak to a man out at the bank here, who says he has as much right to believe in Tom Paine us in the Bible? " Accompanying our friend to the person for whom this anxiety had been awakened, we found a neatly-attired intelligent-looking coloured man, who was evidently trying to ward off the force of the appeals that had been made from the stage, and that were being repeated personally, by the stale, oft-refuted sophisms of infidelity. We declined at once to enter into any argument, but simply stated our conviction that he felt in his inmost soul the truth of all he had heard that night. In short, that he knew we were right and he was wrong, and that if he died in his rebellion and infidelity, he would be lost. We saw him again the following evening, and he became a regular attendant on all our meetings. A short time afterwards, he rose in the theatre, and, before a large crowd, bore the following testimony:

> "A fortnight ago, out of curiosity, I came into this theatre. I had long been trying hard to be an infidel, but I was not satisfied, neither was I happy. The topic of the speaker that morning was purity of heart. I was at once interested and impressed. I came again at night, and was still further convicted; but when friends spoke to me, I was too proud to acknowledge it, and, to my shame, I confess that I tried to ridicule their arguments and entreaties. Nevertheless, I was wounded by the Spirit, and I continued to attend every meeting, and at once set myself to seek the mercy I so greatly needed. I now confessed my state to the people of God, and sought their counsel and their prayers; but I found no rest to my soul. For days I wandered about, seeking God wherever I went. One day, while seeking a berth, I went into a shipping office on Tower Hill. Two men in the office a few minutes before me, had taken a tract given them by a lady; and to show their utter contempt for it, tore it in two, spat upon it, and stuck it up against the wall. While waiting, I took the tract down and read it. In it was a sentence imploring the penitent soul to cease from all working and weeping and anxiety respecting sin, and to trust at once, fully and for ever, to the atonement which Christ had made for the sin of the world. These words were applied to my soul by the ever blessed Spirit, and then, in that office, I cast my guilty soul on Jesus. My burden fell off, and my soul was set free, and since then my happiness has been increasing day by day. My mother was a Christian. She is now in heaven. I promised her on parting, that I would meet with her there. Through mercy I will fulfil my vow."

For several weeks this dear brother went in out and with us, telling of God's dealings with him wherever he came. Soon afterwards he left for sea, and has been voyaging about the world ever since. Once he has been home, and we have just received a letter from him posted in Calcutta. He is as happy as the first day God revealed Himself to him.

A CONVERTED INFIDEL.

> In taking a view of my past life, my heart melts within me, and I cannot bear the thought of giving an account of it. Sufficient is it to say, that I spent the best part of it in committing sins of the darkest dye, one hour blaspheming the name of a merciful God, and daring Him to send me to hell, and another, openly denying His existence, and all this while breaking my dear wife's heart with my oaths and blasphemies. As the Mission people used to pass singing through the street, I used to curse them and wish I had the power to send them all to prison for a nuisance. O my dear sir, often has my wife clung round my neck and tried to stop me swearing, and often have I laid down at night with the bitter wish that it might be my last, and when I have woke in the morning how disappointed have I been to find myself alive. But, glory be to God, the night has become day, the darkness is chased away, and the once blaspheming infidel is now singing the praises of God for the precious gift of His dear Son.
> 
> One evening taking tea with my sons, they earnestly entreated me to go with them to the East London Theatre, which had just been rebuilt, so that they might see inside a theatre for once. I consented, and accompanied them, thinking I should have an opportunity to find fault with the preacher. I watched one and another come on to the stage; presently Mr. Booth came, and commenced the service by singing, which I thought sounded well; after awhile the preacher took his text, to which I listened with great attention. At the commencement of his sermon, I was suddenly struck with the description of the golden calf being ground into powder and given to the people to drink: here I felt a degree of curiosity to know more, and I listened more attentively until he came to ask the question, "Who is on the Lord's side? let him come unto me." This struck me deeply, and I felt that I could not move, for all my past life came up before me, and the remembrance of my sins stung me like an adder.
> 
> I returned home feeling very differently to what I did when I left; no tongue can tell what I felt and what was passing through my mind all the supper time. I went to bed, but not to sleep, and rose no better in the morning, — I passed a wretched week, and the following Sunday went to the Mission Hall. I now resolved if I could find pardon and mercy, I would have it. I went to the Hall again on Monday night, and still pressed my cry till bedtime, and after my family were all asleep I continued pleading for mercy through the precious blood till six o'clock in the morning, when, I felt that my load of sin was gone, all washed away in the precious blood of the Lamb. I now began to praise my God who had set me free: glory, hallelujah!
> 
> After a few weeks, I felt that I must press into a deeper baptism of God's love. Satan said, you must wait a little longer, but I determined to have it, and on Christmas day morning, at the six o'clock experience meeting, God filled me with His love. Since then I have been twice very near to death, but I was saved from all fear and filled with joy. I now desire to spend in this work of the Lord all the rest of my days, and hope, with my dear family, to meet you and your dear wife, and hundreds saved through the Mission, at the marriage supper of the Lamb.

THE STORY OF A CONVERTED BUTCHER, WHO HAD BEEN A THIEF AND A DRUNKARD (TOLD BY HIMSELF)

> Dear sir, — It is now two months since God, through Christ Jesus, pardoned all my sins. I have great reason to remember that glorious day, for it was a happy day to my soul. O, when I look back at my past life, it makes my blood run cold to think that, had not God in His great mercy spared me, I might have been cut off in my sins, and my soul damned in hell. God's Holy Spirit strove with me from a little boy, but I always resisted Him. When the Lord thought fit to call my parents away, then I would not give Him my heart, but went on doing everything wicked. Then God afflicted me with a heavy fever, from which it was expected I should never recover, but God raised me up after the space of two mouths, and provided a kind friend who took me in, fed and clothed me, and taught me the way to God. But after all this, instead of serving God, I served the devil. I left this friend and went out in the world, and mixed up with bad companions, doing everything bad in the sight of God; at last I went to work, and regularly got drunk with the money I worked hard for all the week.
> 
> I then became very fond of going to concert-rooms, and I went on so bad that I found my earnings would not serve me. I then took to thieving and drinking more than ever.
> 
> On the 17th of December, 1867, I got drunk and received one month's imprisonment. While in prison I made up my mind to serve God, but when I came out I soon forgot all my good resolutions, and pursued my wicked life as before.
> 
> At last I got work with one of the brothers of this Mission. Another brother also worked for him; and being much together, he very soon told me not to swear, and talked to me about God, and what He had done for him. He often asked me to go to the East London Theatre. I used to promise him I would, but never went.
> 
> At last, one Sunday afternoon, he called at my house for me, and said, "I have got you now; I have come to fetch yon to the Theatre." I thought to myself how can I go there to-day? It was only last night I was drunk, fighting, and thieving. Nevertheless he stuck close to me, and would not let me off; so I went with him to the experience meeting. As one brother after another told us what they had been, and what they were then, I felt ashamed of myself. I thought I was a wretched sinner, and wished myself away; but my mate stuck close to me. Then he took me to the tea at the hall, and while they were all singing, I felt alone, and wanted to get out, but he stuck close to me. Then there was a prayer meeting, and when I heard the brothers pray to God to save poor sinners, I was deeply convicted that I had a soul unsaved, and unless I gave up my sins I should be damned. I felt then I should like to get out, but my mate kept close to me. Then I went down with them, singing as they passed along; and as I passed the end of our street I thought I could get off, but he would not let me slip, and so I went to the theatre.
> 
> Mr. Booth preached, and it seemed as though he was talking to me alone, for every word he said seemed to cut me to the heart; my head dropped, tears came, and at last I was obliged to give in. I went on to the stage and gave God my heart, and my sins, which were many, were all forgiven; and now, by the grace of God, I am walking in the narrow way which leads to glory. I have no trouble with my old companions, they have all left me. I get a little persecution, but I look to Jesus, and He brings me through.

This brother has passed through untold persecution and trial, but he still holds on and walks consistently.

We will now let another brother tell his story. He had been

A BLASPHEMER AND AN INFIDEL.

> Glory to Jesus! He sought me when a stranger, for I have been a stranger to God since I was twelve years of age. I had a good, loving mother, but an ungodly, drunken father. When at that age, I used to tell my father it was a shame I had to go to Sunday-school, and he allowed me to stay away, and I went into the streets, and in a very short time became a greater blackguard than any of my associates. The deeper we went into wickedness the better I liked it.
> 
> At the age of eighteen, through illness, I was compelled to be steadier. My mother told me that I had better prepare to meet God, for there was no hope for me in this world. I told her there was no good God in heaven, or He wouldn't let me suffer so. My mother used to talk to me, and I became steadier, but I was still without God, and without hope in the world.
> 
> My father would take me to bell-ringing on Sunday nights, and I became a regular attendant at the infidel Hall of Science. Reckless of everything, I did not believe in hell, or any hereafter.
> 
> I now got married, and was steady for about three years, but still heedless of the word of God. I got used to frequenting the public-house, associating with the worst of companions, and among others there were three ticket-of-leave-men, and I longed to be like them, getting my living easily. About the only good quality in me was, I had been honest all my life; I never neglected my work, and always bore a character wherever I was employed, until the 6th December, 1866, when, prompted by the example of those men, I stole an article worth two and sixpence. I was arrested and charged with felony; but, it being my first offence, the magistrate tried me on the charge of illegal possession, fined me a sovereign, and dismissed me with severe reprimand, my employer having given me nine years' good character. That night, in the station-house, before my trial, I had the horrors so bad that I could not sleep a moment: I heard the clock strike all the hours and chime the quarters. When I thought of my wife and sister crying so bitterly for me, I thought that I should have gone mad; and I resolved that ever after I would, with God's help, be steady, and never again keep bad company. I tried to pray, but all I could say was, "Lord, help me, and keep me steady. This resolution I have kept, I left off frequenting the public-house, and gave up my evil associates; but I remained as great a blasphemer as ever, and would boast of my unbelief in the existence of hell.
> 
> One Sunday evening, a sister-in-law, who was living with us, asked me to come to the Effingham Theatre. I laughed and ridiculed, and with an oath, asked her if there was anything good to be given away there, but the next minute I said I would go, and did so, Mr. Booth preached from "The rich man and Lazarus," and I was convinced of the existence of a hell, and that it would be my eternal home if I did not alter. I felt deeply that I was in the wrong way, but would not show it until they sang —
> 
> "Just as I am — and waiting not
> To rid my soul of one dark spot —
> To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each blot,
> Oh! Lamb of God, I come."
> 
> It was then I saw that my heart was all black. A brother came and asked me how was my soul. I lied to him, saying that it was all right; but I was so convicted that, after I got home, I prayed that God would make me a true and sincere Christian. That night I gave my heart to God, obtained the pardon of all my sins, and have, through the love of Christ, ever since continued in prayer, and walked in the path which leads to glory.

The following letter was written for "THE EVANGELIST" by a dear brother, now in heaven, who for many years was connected with various kinds of effort for the temporal and spiritual elevation of the poor of the East of London.

A FLASH IN THE PAN.

> Dear Brother — A few days since, I had occasion to call upon a gentleman who is the principal of a thriving firm in the city, and who has all his life deeply interested himself in the relief of the suffering poor, I asked him to come and see the work being carried on by the East London Christian Mission. He promised to do so; but at the same time told me that, in conversing with some gentlemen the previous evening, he had been informed that it was all "a flash in the pan" — a little excitement that would soon wear off. Faring that some few, into whose hands the "Evangelist" may fall, may have heard the same, I send an account of several cases which I have watched over myself for a long time, and in whose lives I have seen the truth of the words, "Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
> 
> J.F. —, who had lived all his life without hope and without God in the world, and who had not entered a place of worship since the day he was married, was induced by a friend, who had himself been converted under Mr. Booth's preaching, to attend a service. He did so, and was very much impressed, and returned home unhappy. He continued to attend the meetings until he found peace through believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. He has, for the three years past, lived a most consistent Christian life, though much persecuted by his fellow-workmen, and is doing all he can to bring sinners to the Saviour.
> 
> G. T —, who had always lived a strictly moral and respectable life, was awakened by hearing the singing in the street. He was asked to attend the theatre service, which he did; and was there enabled to feel the power of God unto salvation. In the experience meeting, a few weeks since, he said how deeply he regretted that the best years of his life had not been devoted to the service of Him "that loved us and washed us from our sins;" for now he feels that he has but the remnant of his days to work for Jesus.
>

She replied, "Worse! oh, no, but a great deal better; for since we have known the Lord, we have never wanted a Sunday's dinner, while last year we had not more than twenty out of the fifty-two Sundays."

These indicate, I think, something more than "a flash in the pan." If any doubt or would like more satisfactory evidence, I entreat them to come and see for themselves. If they will send me a line, I will gladly make an appointment, and introduce them to hundreds of persons, either at the meetings or at their own homes, when they shall hear from their own lips of the marvellous changes the religion of Jesus has wrought in their hearts, homes, and daily lives, through the instrumentality of this Mission.

About the time the meetings wore commenced in the East London Theatre, we were enabled, by the liberality of our friends, to purchase the lease of

THE EASTERN STAR BEER HOUSE.

The place had been recently burnt down, and for £120 we obtained possession, and from a soul-ruining establishment of the very worst kind, we turned it into a house of God, and a gate to heaven. The following sketch of the place appeared in the Christian World about the time we opened it:

> Some two or three years since, there might have been seen, in that part of the Whitechapel-road where the stream of foot traffic is perhaps most dense, and where gin-shops drive a roaring trade, a low beer-house, designated as the" Eastern Star." We generally associate stars with all that is pure, bright, and beautiful; but the Whitechapel orb possessed none of these qualities; it was simply a vile, reeking haunt of drunken abominations, where roughs, loafers, and other loose characters assembled together for the purpose of passing their evenings in noisy dissipation, and where the hard working artisan was tempted to squander in drink the earnings which should have assisted in providing food and clothing for his wife and family. Here the courtesan, the gambler, and the swindler continually plied their infamous vocations, and here also youths on the threshold of manhood were ceaselessly initiated in the ruinous and soul-destroying arts of vice, and even criminality. Suddenly there came a stop in the high and rushing tide of wickedness. One night the neighbours were startled from their slumbers by cries of "Fire! Fire!" The public-house was in flames. In vain did the firemen exert themselves to the uttermost, in vain did the engines pour mighty torrents of hissing water on the fiery burning mass; for when the cold grey light of the morning dawned, a shapeless, blackened mass of ruins was all that was left of the building, known far and wide amongst beer-drinkers and spirit-bibbers as the "Eastern Star."
> 
> By and by, however, it began to be rumoured that the public-house would be speedily rebuilt. Public-house keeping is a trade too profitable not to find plenty of followers, and in re-erecting the premises it was felt that there would be no difficulty in finding a tenant. So, before many months had elapsed, a bran-new structure occupied the place of that burnt down. Every arrangement had been made for the commencement of a large and flourishing trade, and the neighbours had good reasons to fear the consequences of its re-opening. Fortunately the East Loudon Christian Mission was at this time much in want of suitable premises in Whitechapel to be used as a mission hall, and the thought occurred to their leader that it would be a circumstance both encouraging and significant could the newly-built public-house be secured for such a purpose. It would be one hot-bed of drunkenness and vice the less in a neighbourhood where the temptations to intemperance and sin are but too numerous. No sooner said than done. About three months ago, the Rev. W. Booth, by whom the labours of the East London Christian Mission are directed, made an appeal to Christians for £160, to purchase the lease of the premises, and make the necessary alterations. That appeal was successful, and the "Eastern Star," so long a stronghold of irreligion and shameless iniquity, has now become transformed into a centre of evangelising effort.

Though small in comparison with our requirements, the place proved a great success. It was generally full, and three or four times in every week it was crowded most uncomfortably, so much so, that persons at all delicate could not remain in it, and therefore numbers stayed away. Nevertheless, much blessed work was done; and when it was exchanged for our present eligible and commodious premises, it was with very great regret that we bade the place farewell. In passing on from it in this brief notice, the recollection of the conversion of a dear brother, now serving God far away from us, strikes us so forcibly that we cannot refrain from recording it here.

A FAST YOUNG MAN.

Not long up from the country, caught in the rapid stream of dissipation, drinking, and swearing, he might be seen at the concert-hall of an evening, with his glass, applauding the comic singer; or, on the Sabbath, with a white hat and a cigar, strutting to and fro in Victoria Park, listening to the band. But, in a remarkable manner, all this was changed. One evening, as he reached the entrance of his favourite concert-hall, the desire to enter strangely left him, and turning round, he retraced his steps towards home. As he passed up the Whitechapel-road, his eye was attracted by the word NOW, which, in large letters, was placed over the entrance to the hall. Wondering what it could mean, and seeing people enter, he passed inside, was awakened to a sense of his guilt and danger, and a few days afterwards found peace in Jesus. He became one of the happiest and most zealous members of our Mission; and in much tribulation and long and unchanging persecution honoured the Saviour; and now, although far away from us, we doubt not he is still following the Master, and spreading abroad the honours of His name.

Although " The Eastern Star" was very useful, and the Theatre most attractive, drawing large audiences; and though we had other rooms close by, which served for small meetings, sewing classes, &c., still our accommodation was for from being equal to our requirements; and, moreover, was very expensive, costing us fully £400 per annum. And yet we were without any room capable of containing the crowds of people who thronged to hear the gospel on a week night, or that was suitable for a large tea meeting, unless we paid three or four pounds for the hire of one. Consequently, much prayer was offered that God would open our way to a place of our own, fully adapted for our work; and after long waiting and weary searching, the premises formerly used as a people's market were offered, and with funds contributed by our friends were purchased; and, after the needed alterations, were opened on the 10th of April, 1870, as

THE WHITECHAPEL PEOPLE'S MISSION HALL.

> "The Whitechapel Road is probably one of the most crowded thoroughfares in the kingdom, especially in the evening, when thousands, nay, tens of thousands, of people, belonging principally to the labouring class, are ceaselessly passing to and fro over the broad pavements which skirt the spacious roadway. It may be called, and with much reason, 'Labour's Boulevard,' a few trees being all that are wanting to complete the resemblance to the crowded public promenades which form such a distinctive feature of the French capital. In the Whitechapel Road, however, the public-house, with its beer and gin, usurps the place of the Parisian café — certainly not to the advantage or credit of the East-end artisan. In fact, the public-house seems to form an essential component of social life in the Whitechapel Road, for it meets us at every step, turn we either to the right or to the left. Some few are simply beer-shops, but the others are gin palaces, glittering temples of the drink-god. These places are seldom empty. Many are constantly crowded, day and evening, and it is stated that into two of these no less than 3774 persons were observed to enter within the space of five hours during a single Sabbath day, thus affording — were it required — another proof of the lamentable fact that the public-house and irreligion are indissolubly linked together."

To the front of this great thoroughfare, in the midst of these flaming gin palaces, and near neighbour to two of the largest theatres in the East of London, our Hall is situated. It opens with a noble portico directly on the spacious pavement, and will comfortably seat fifteen hundred persons; but with the folding and sliding doors thrown open, which divide the portico and large room over it, and with the aisles seated, it will contain two thousand people. In the portico, which of itself will hold one hundred and fifty persons, and which opens to the street, we can preach to the passers by, and so secure a congregation day or night, week day or Sabbath. Over this is another room of equal size, in which larger private meetings can be held, while there are also nine smaller rooms for classes, residence of Hall keepers, a bedroom for an evangelist who may be visiting us for a few days, and all the other requirements of the different agencies and operations of the Mission. In addition, we have a large shop and soup kitchen in which soup and cheap provisions are sold to the door in connection with the similar premises described at page 34; the whole forming in the estimation of all who have visited them, the most complete and best situated premises for evangelistic work among the poor to be found in the kingdom. The purchase of the original building and alterations have cost over £3,000, while we pay as ground rent £135 per year.

Although the Hall has only been open a few months, we are happy to know that much has been done in it for God and eternity. Services are commenced at seven o'clock on a Sabbath morning with a prayer-meeting; at eight there is a breakfast, tickets threepence each. After breakfast, an address on some spiritual topic, with a conversation on the subject. After this all again unite in prayer, and then the friends divide, some going into the open-air, and others to the public service in the Hall. Even during the dinner hour the premises are not empty, seeing that friends coming from a distance often bring a little provision, and partake of it together in the smaller rooms, so that there is generally prayer and praise before the commencement of the afternoon services. At half-past two we hold an experience meeting, at which those who have been blessed and saved in the movement tell what the Lord has done for them, often awakening in other hearts the desire for like precious blessings. At the close of this meeting tea is provided on the same terms as the breakfast. This is a great convenience for many who come long distances, and for others who, gathered out of households which have no sympathy with religion, find it a blessed privilege to remain with those whose tastes and sympathies are one with their own. These Sabbath afternoon teas are often seasons of great encouragement and refreshing, cheering the hearts of many whose week-day life is one weary round of toil and persecution. After tea all again unite in prayer for a blessing on the evening meetings, and then dividing into bands, adjourn to the crowded streets to proclaim the blessed gospel, and to press the wandering throngs to attend the evening service in the Hall. After the preaching we hold a prayer meeting. The Sabbath services have not only been times of refreshing, but have always been crowned with anxious souls. Sometimes as many as twenty have sought mercy on the same evening; and so precious is the place felt to be, that it is always left with reluctance. Hundreds have already been blessed in it, and we have reason to hope that in the Iast great day multitudes will recur to this as the birthplace of their souls.

During the week a mid-day service is held every day from one till two, and continued longer where there are anxious souls, while every night there are services in the Hall, preceded by a meeting in the open air, and minor gatherings specially designed for the edification of believers in the smaller rooms. On Friday evening all meet together to hear and pray about holy living, while every Saturday night there is a temperance meeting.

We have thus particularly described the meetings at Whitechapel, because they will serve to indicate the character of the services held at all the stations hereafter mentioned. In addition to those already given, we purposed narrating other incidents which would further illustrate the working of the varied agencies at this station, but find that our space will not permit.

This chapter forms the fourth section of William Booth's "How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel," serving as a detailed case study of the Christian Mission's expansion strategy in Victorian London. Beginning with the humble origins at Whitechapel—the "mother station"—Booth chronicles the Mission's evolution from tent meetings to permanent facilities, demonstrating how innovative use of unconventional venues (dancing rooms, theatres, former public houses) could effectively reach the urban poor. The extensive conversion testimonies and newspaper reports provide valuable primary source material documenting early Salvation Army methodology and the social conditions of East London's working classes. This chapter establishes the practical foundation for the Mission's later global expansion, showing how persistent evangelism combined with social concern could transform both individuals and communities in the most challenging urban environments.
