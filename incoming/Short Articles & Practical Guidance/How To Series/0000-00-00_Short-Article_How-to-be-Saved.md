# How to be Saved

_A Ladder of Seven Steps by which any Sinner may climb out of the condemnation and bondage of his sins into the forgiveness and favor of God._

**BY THE LATE GENERAL WILLIAM BOOTH**

---

This ladder is for the use of those who have a serious desire to obtain the mercy of God, which alone can deliver them from their evil habits, from the power of the devil, and from the wrath to come. To those who use it, I give the following counsel:

**1.** Set apart a special time for its consideration, retiring, if possible, into some quiet place where you can be alone with God.

**2.** Read the paper carefully and thoughtfully from first to last, and then go through it again as afterwards described.

**3.** Earnestly pray for that guidance of the Holy Spirit which God has promised to all who seek Him. He says, "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your Heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?"

**4.** With all your heart, on your knees before God, take one step at a time. Be careful not to leave the first step for the second until it is clearly understood, heartily accepted, and solemnly decided upon; and so on with the second and third steps, until the last is reached.

**5.** If this course be followed, I feel quite sure that no sincere person will fail to reach not only the mercy-seat, but the loving arms of the Saviour and the knowledge of the forgiveness of their sins.

## FIRST STEP
### Discovery of Sin

I am a sinner. I have sinned against my God, against my neighbor, and against my own soul. I have sinned in my thoughts, in my feelings, in my conversation, and in my actions. I have sinned at home, in my family, and I have sinned in the world, in my business and pleasures. I have done the things I ought not to have done, and left undone the things I ought to have done. I freely admit it. I will not cover my sins. They have been more in number than I can count, and grievous beyond the possibility of calculation. They have dishonored my Heavenly Father, treated the sacrifice of my Saviour with contempt, exercised a bad influence upon those who have known me in the world. I deserve the everlasting displeasure of God, and I see that if I die in my sins I shall fall into the damnation of Hell. O Lord, have mercy upon me!

## SECOND STEP
### Sorrow for Sin

Not only do I see that I have sinned against God, but I am truly sorry for having done so. I hate my evil ways, and I hate myself for having followed them. I am grieved on account of my sins — not only because they have exposed me to punishment, but because they have been committed against my Heavenly Father who has continually loved and cared for me. If I could undo the past gladly would I do so; but, alas! I cannot. The sins I have committed are written down against me in the Book of God's remembrance. No prayers that I can offer — no tears that I can shed — no lamentations that I can make — no good works that I can perform — will remove that terrible record. My only hope is in the forgiving mercy of Jesus Christ, who has said, "Him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out."

## THIRD STEP
### Confession of Sin

Not only am I sorry on account of my sins, but I freely confess and acknowledge them before God. I have no excuse to make for them. It may be true that much of the evil of which I have been guilty has been done in ignorance. I did not know God, nor my duty to Him, not the greatness of the love of my Saviour in dying for me. I was ignorant of the evil influence which my conduct and example were often exercising on others. But this ignorance is no real excuse, because I might have known better. I ought to have read my Bible and listened to those who would have taught me. I ought to have read my Bible and listened to those who would have taught me. I ought to have thought about my soul, and cried to God for help. But I did not, and consequently my mouth is closed before Him. And I do here and now confess myself before God to be a guilty sinner, without excuse, deserving His anger now and forever.

Not only do I make this confession in private, but seeing that I have sinned in the presence of my family, and of the people around me, I am perfectly willing to confess my sinfulness, and my sorrow on account of it, as far as I have the opportunity, before the Lord's people, before my own family and before the world. Not having been ashamed to sin in the presence of others, I am willing to acknowledge it in their presence.

## FOURTH STEP
### Putting Away Sin

Not only do I see myself to be a sinner and hate my sins, and confess them before God and man, but I do now, by God's help, renounce and give up every one of them. Whatever pleasure they may have brought me in the past, and whatever earthly gain they may promise me in the future, I do here and now, in the strength of God, put them away, and promise that I will never take them back again.

## FIFTH STEP
### Asking Forgiveness For Sin

Feeling how shamefully I have rebelled against my Heavenly father in despising His love, in breaking His commandments, and in influencing others to do the same, I do here and now, on my knees, submit myself to Him, humbly praying that He will have mercy upon me, a miserable sinner, and begging Him for Christ's sake to forgive all my sins, to receive me into His favor, and make me, unworthy as I am, a member of His family.

## SIXTH STEP
### Consecration

I promised God, here and now, in His strength, and with all my heart, that if He will forgive me and receive me into His favor, I will from this time engage to be His faithful servant, promising to spend the rest of my days in doing what I can for His glory, for the extension of His Kingdom, and for the salvation of those around me.

## SEVENTH STEP
### Faith

I believe that Jesus Christ, God's Son, in His great mercy and love died for me and in my place, bearing my sins in His own body on the Cross. And believing this I do here and now welcome Him to my heart as my Saviour from Hell, from sin, from the power of the devil. Jesus Christ says in the Bible that if I will come to Him, He will in no wise cast me out; and I do come to Him with all my heart just now, as a poor, helpless, guilty sinner, seeking salvation, and trusting only in His Blood, I am sure that He will not reject me. Nay, as well as I can, I believe that He does at this very moment take me in. He forgives me now. His precious Blood washes all my sins away. He was wounded for my transgressions; He was bruised for my iniquities; the punishment I ought to have endured was laid upon Him, and with His sufferings I am healed. I am forgiven.

**Praise the Lord! Jesus saves me now!**

This "Ladder of Seven Steps" represents one of William Booth's most systematic and practical approaches to personal evangelism. Written as a self-guided conversion tool, it demonstrates Booth's ability to break down complex theological concepts into clear, actionable steps that anyone could follow.

The document reflects several key aspects of Booth's evangelistic methodology: the emphasis on personal responsibility and acknowledgment of sin, the requirement for genuine emotional engagement (sorrow), the importance of public confession, the necessity of complete abandonment of sinful practices, and the culmination in an act of faith that brings immediate assurance of salvation.

This structured approach became a foundational tool for Salvation Army evangelism, used by officers worldwide to guide seekers through the conversion process. The progression from conviction to consecration embodies Booth's understanding that true conversion required both emotional transformation and practical commitment to a new way of life. The document's emphasis on immediate assurance ("Jesus saves me now!") reflects the Army's distinctive teaching that salvation could be experienced and known instantaneously through faith.
