# How to Do a Soldiers' Meeting

_December, 1899 by William Booth_

---

KEEPING people saved is coming to be regarded amongst us as being almost, if not quite, as important a duty as getting them saved. The conviction is also gradually forcing itself on the minds of our Officers that keeping Soldiers pressing on the Heavenly Road is as truly dependent on the truth taught and the training given as persuading and them to turn their feet into it. If you don't use appropriate means for the attainment of the object, you have no grounds for expecting men to be saved; and if you don't use appropriate means you have no valid reason for expecting that they will keep saved.

The loss of Soldiers amongst us is admitted, on all hands, to be appalling. If we only kept a reasonable proportion of the number that we win we should soon be as the sands of the seashore for numbers.

## OUR LOSSES.

It is true that the wear and tear amongst us is greater by far than that of any other Christian Organization in the world. Some of the causes from which we suffer are beyond remedy. Some are not. The following, among other reasons, count for many of our losses:

**1. The high standard of holy living and action which we set before our people costs us a multitude of Soldiers.** Take, for instance, The Army's views on —

Truth, Honesty, and general Uprightness in Business.

The Prohibition of the Wearing of Gold and Silver Ornaments and Fashionable Apparel.

The strong recommendation of Uniform.

The insistence upon Total Abstinence from the use of Intoxicating Liquors as a beverage.

The Condemnation, almost amounting to Prohibition, of Tobacco

These, together with a host of other regulations and usages, not only keep multitudes out of our ranks, but are common reasons why so many leave them, often going to the Churches, where they can enjoy worldly indulgences in peace.

**2. Many forsake our ranks because they get tired of the Open-air work, and yet condemned by Comrades and their own conscience if they neglect it.**

### COUNTER ATTRACTIONS!

**3. Many Soldiers leave our ranks and ally themselves with the various Imitation Armies and Movements that surround us, who, with a lower religious standard and greater worldly charm, lure them away.** Officers often say to me, "Look at the competition we have in this Town — in Buildings, Bands, etc.!"

**4. There will be no question that we lose many Soldiers through the special temptations to which the class from whom they are recruited are more particularly subjected.** There are old companions, the force of old habits, and recreation and other special seasons and circumstances of inducement.

**5. No doubt we lose many Soldiers through persecution.** The fight is hard. Single-handed, in shops, in factories, on farms, in ships, in regiments, in families, to be a Salvationist is to live a life of continued torture.

**6. Very many of our Soldiers are young people, very often being the only ones even professing religion in unconverted families.** Fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters all against them, reviling them continually, instead of its being a wonder that they fall, it is a miracle that so many of them stand.

**7. The migratory habits, by the force of circumstances, costs us many Soldiers.** Our people are mostly poor, and, by reason of the vicissitudes of Trade and other things, they have to move from town to town, and so are lost to us. Many emigrate to distant lands and are heard of no more. Many move off to towns where we have no Corps, and, instead of at once setting to work to get The Army represented there, they settle down with some church, or, alas! fall away from religion altogether.

It is true that a better system of transfer, or, rather, the more careful attention to the Orders and regulations we already possess on that subject, would save us many losses in this respect.

**8. The false notion that The Army has not the proper position and authority of a church costs us some Soldiers.**

### IGNORANCE.

**9. The ignorance of many of our converts of the first principles of morality — to say nothing about religion — is another cause of loss.** See the classes from which we recruit our forces. Many of our Soldiers are, unfortunately, up to the hour of their conversion, the slaves of drink or some other equally vulgar vices, and on any relapse they give up and go back to their former state in despair. The converts of the more respectable and moral classes will lose their hold on Gold, and come again under the power of former sins, while keeping up their religious profession, with its attendance on meetings and the like, whereas those of whom I am speaking will rush headlong into the old passions, and their last state will be worse than their first.

These and other causes are continually drawing away from us the souls for whom we have wept and prayed and toiled, over whose captures we have rejoiced, and on whose cooperation in a conflict we had counted.

## REMEDIES.

But can nothing be devised to prevent these losses? Is there no remedy? Of course there is. There are several well-known remedies. What are they?

Well, first and foremost, there is **more Salvation**. "Red-hot religion" will hold our people, not only in our ranks, but make them love the Fight, surmount their difficulties, resist their temptations, and glory in persecution. It is when men and women lose their first love, or allow some secret sin to creep into their lives, that they become tired of fighting their Lord; it is then they forsake their comrades and desert The Salvation Army. More religion red-hot religion - will keep our Soldiers from falling.

### ACTIVE WORK.

**2. Work is another remedy** that will suggest itself to the brethren who will read this. I think I hear Officers repeating what, in various forms, I am always saying, "Use your Soldiers. Set them to work.

> 'Satan finds some mischief still,
> For idle hands to do.'

"Lay distinct responsibility upon their shoulders. Give them a task. Keep them at their duty. Lead them on. Cheer them in their discouragements. Push them forwards. While they fight they will persevere."

### KNOWLEDGE.

**3. But there is another want** which, if not as important as those named, is a long way on for being so, and that is **more intelligence**. I am satisfied thousands of Soldiers are lost to us every year through their ignorance of the nature of religion, its duties, its enemies, and the means that are necessary to maintain the fire of Divine love burning in the soul.

Moreover, I am sure we lose many Soldiers from our ranks because they are so ignorant of the Government, Principles, and Working of The Army, and of the position it occupies in the world.

Knowledge is power. We want our Soldiers to be able to stand against the strong opposition which they have to fight at home and abroad, from men and devils, and one way of enabling them to do so is by Instruction. And there are few questions of greater importance than that which asks, "How can we impart that knowledge which will not only keep our Soldiers in our ranks, but enable them to fight a good fight and help us to win the multitudes to Christ after which our souls hunger?"

Now, without under-estimating the importance of the two first named means of conserving our forces, I want to direct special attention to the last. While we do more to increase the love of our Soldiers for God and souls, and use them more carefully in the War, we must give them more instruction also.

But how can this be done? That is the question I propose to answer. And in doing so I want to keep my eyes on the smaller as well as the youngest and least capable Captain who has a Command within our ranks.

## A PRACTICAL PLAN.

There is one way in which I think it can be done, and that is by means of the weekly **Soldiers' Meeting**. This Meeting, I am afraid, has, in some cases, been sadly neglected amongst us. Let that neglect be a thing of the past. It can be made a reality and a success with little difficulty if the instructions I now give are carried out. Let every Officer put his hand to the plough, and that Meeting will become not merely a means of promoting red hot religion and saving souls, but of imparting to the Soldier that advice and instruction which I feel to be so important a part of the work of preserving and helping him in the love and service of God.

Now, let me remind you again that I am going to lay down a plan which can be followed by the humblest Officer in the smallest Corps within our borders, and which, if followed, will, I think, ensure the object at which I am aiming, and that is

### A GOOD SOLDIERS' MEETING.

The Officer in command must have a clear idea as to what he wants to do:

**1. To make every Soldier wiser than he was when he came into the Barracks.** That is, to impart some solid instruction on some useful topic to all present, and that in such a practical way that he can go and carry it out. It may not be a great deal that is learned, but something on some matter that has to do with everyday experience, or duty, or worship, should be taught.

**2. To make every Soldier better.** The tide is strong against them; the temptations are heavy and constant; grace ebbs and flows within their souls; we want to help hem to grow in grace.

**3. To encourage every Soldier to hold on to God and to keep believing.** Few things are more needful than a continual cheering up. The discouragements and sorrows of an ordinary Soldier's life are many and severe.

**4. To make every Soldier more in love with doing good and better qualified for accomplishing it.**

**5. To bring God nearer to every Soldier, and to bring every Soldier nearer to God.**

It may be said that this is a large order. Well, so it is. But it is simple, and possible, and necessary; and therefore every Officer can at least see it to be the proper end for which the Soldier's Meeting is held, and can at least aim at it.

Now, how is the Officer to gain this end? Let me see:

**1. He must have the Soldiers' Meeting carefully announced,** together with the subject that is going to be considered. But some Officers who read this may say, "How can I get up a subject?" Wait a little, and I will show you.

### A PRIVILEGE.

**2. Rigidly confine your meeting to Soldiers and Recruits.** Let no one else in unless it is someone seeking Salvation, and then only by a permit from the Captain. Make it a felt privilege to be allowed to be present. You have plenty of public meetings; this must be strictly private. This is for "the family."

**3. Hunt up those Soldiers** who you may have reason to fear may not be likely to attend, and those who, for some reason or other, or no reason at all, may absent themselves from time to time.

**4. Don't be discouraged by having only a few Soldiers at your gathering.** If you can only raise a dozen, value the opportunity. I have fought hard at similar meetings with only five or six, and had excellent times and precious results following.

### SHOULDER RESPONSIBILITY.

**5. Take the responsibility of the meeting on your own shoulders.** Get whatever help you can in the way I shall point out; but you must remember that this is specially your meeting, and you must do the very best you can for it, both beforehand and while it is in progress.

**6. Choose your topic.** Fix on one that you feel fits the experience and needs of your Corps. You say, "Oh! I have only been out from the Training Home six months. How can I do this great thing?" I say again, "Wait a bit and I will show you a plan which will make the task not only possible, but easy." That is, I will not only show you how you can find a suitable topic, but how you can deal with it in the most useful and interesting manner.

**7. Say nothing yourself, and have nothing said by other people, that cannot be easily understood by every Soldier present.**

### NO DISCUSSION.

**8. Don't allow any appearance of controversy.** If anyone wants any explanation of what is said, or to know anything further on the same subject, let them ask you in private, and then you can either answer them in private or at the next meeting.

**9. Get some life into your meeting at the beginning:** —

(a) Get all present close together. If it is winter, and you have only a handful, bring them round the stove.

(b) Wake them up with a rousing song.

(c) Have some earnest prayer. Make the recruits pray.

(d) Get everybody into a state of expectancy.

### NEWS.

**10. Review the events of the week.**

(a) Refer to what has ben done in the Corps. If no souls have been saved, and no recruits added, talk straight to them. Lay the responsibility on them.

(b) Refer to the principal news in the Cry.

(c) If anything has happened in the town, of interest, mention it and draw some lessons from it.

**11. Come to your topic.** Twenty minutes, at the longest.

**12. Publish what you want to do in the Corps.** Always have something to announce on which you want the assistance and prayers of your Soldiers.

**13. Go in for a baptism of the Holy Spirit at the conclusion:**

(a) Get everybody down before God.

(b) Make those who pray ask for a particular thing.

(c) Draw out all desire and faith for a present blessing.

(d) Finish up with a united reconsecration

This comprehensive guide addresses one of the most pressing challenges facing the early Salvation Army: the significant loss of converts after their initial salvation experience. Written in December 1899, Booth demonstrates his practical leadership approach by providing detailed, actionable instructions for conducting effective Soldiers' Meetings that would help retain and develop new converts. The document reveals the Army's recognition that emotional conversion alone was insufficient without proper instruction, community support, and ongoing spiritual development. The extensive list of suggested topics shows the breadth of practical Christian living that Booth believed essential for maintaining faith in a hostile environment.
