# How to Fail (Part 2)

_From "Short Articles & Practical Guidance" by William Booth_

**FEBRUARY, 1899**

**Being Some Counsels for the Field Captain Who Is Desirous of Not Succeeding in His Corps.**

I have not received an intimation from a solitary soul as to how the advice I gave on this subject in the last Officer was received. No one has hinted to me as to whether it was read, or esteemed; or tried, much less have I heard whether any Captain derived any instruction from the admirable counsels I gave on that occasion! Being, therefore, in the dark as to whether any result came of that effort, I am a little perplexed about going any further. However, I will add another chapter, and then, if nothing happens, I Shall feel like giving the attempt up, and consider that no further counsel is required on the subject. But to resume. I left off at Advice No. 18, so my start today will be: —

19. The Officer who wants to fail should avoid everything like novelty. He should not attempt new ventures, or strive to push his Corps, or get men saved by going outside the old fashioned Ways of doing things. Let him stick to the old ruts. Keep all the Open-airs and Processions and everything else on the same plans and in the same places as from the beginning. He can with good effect take for his motto the saying: "As it was in the beginning in this Corps, so it is now, and so it ever shall be. Amen."

20. Don't wear yourself out with extra meetings on Sundays, or on Feasts, Fairs, or Festivals, or at any other times. To have meetings outside on such occasions, when the whole population is running after pleasure, or engaged in feasting or extra business, with a lot of drunks about who would be likely to insult you would look as if you were mad on the subject of religion, and did not care what people said or did about you so that you could get souls saved and fill your Barracks. That would never do.

21. If your Barracks is full every Sunday night, don't let any question be raised about getting a larger building, or any enquiry be made as to whether you could not get a Theatre, or some other popular place for Sunday nights, where you would be likely to reach a crowd of people who would never, under any pretext whatever, be persuaded to come to your own place.

22. If your Hall is not full, don't let anyone suppose that you are unhappy about it, or worrying night and day to find out some plan of getting the crowds to come and be saved who fill the streets and roads and parks close by, walking and jesting on the highway to Hell, or who are grovelling in filth, and debauched with drink and stupidity in the Slums equally near at hand, although in another direction.

23. In your talking, it is a fine, thing to be perfectly careless whether the people care about what you are saying or not. If you can manage to acquire the habit of seeming to be saying something that is very true and important and Scriptural, and with the Saviour's name often brought into it, which does not make any impression or produce any conviction on anybody, neither making them laugh nor cry, nor at all concerned, although living in sin, rebelling against High Heaven, and travelling down to destruction, that will be a style admirably adapted for the purpose on which I am writing.

24. Next to this style of talking, I recommend you to go in hot and strong for simply interesting the people; that is, amusing them. The easiest way to do this will be to tell them stories — religious, of course, but they should have plenty of fun in them. By that means you will keep an audience happy in their sins, and perhaps, although not always, get something extra out of them for the Collection.

25. When you speak against sin — which you will do at times — you should manage to go in heavy against y drunkenness, and fornication, and harlotry, and blasphemy, and other open and vulgar vices, but you should always carefully avoid saying anything that is likely to apply personally to the Congregation you are dealing with, or make them miserable, because, don't you see, that might wound somebody's feelings, and make them feel that they were condemned by God and on their way to Hell, and bring them to their knees crying, "God be merciful to me a sinner!"

26. In praying, never lift up your voice and cry aloud as the old Prophets did, or allow yourself to be agitated, or appear to be at all anxious that anybody else in the place should pray beside yourself, or that any blessing should come to anyone's heart in particular, either your own or anyone else's, because you pray.

27. In calling on Soldiers to pray, be sure and always keep to "the old ring," specially avoiding the sisters. Anyway, always contrive to do the Conservative, and so keep things as quiet as possible, whatever else may happen.

28. In singing, pay no attention to either Topic or Time or Pitch or Tune, and as to the selection of your Song, take anything the Band can play, whether the people can sing it or not, and whether it is suitable to your audience or the character of your meeting or not; and if you have no Band, then take what the people can sing easily, in which case you will ever have the same thing over and over again. Indeed, as to Singing and a great deal else that you do, you might have a Four-Week Arrangement, and do exactly the same things over and over again, and at the end of the month begin and go the same form of services over again. Indeed, you might make the plan apply not only to the singing, but to your Addresses, Open-Air Work, and everything else you do, and then the people will gradually grow sick of the sameness of your affair, together with its utter want of interest and power, and fall off one by one.

29. When there are any special meetings conducted by the General, the Chief of the Staff, the P.O. or the D.O., or any other Officer likely to be attractive, arrange everything, as nearly as you can, so as to prevent those classes being influenced to attend who might be likely to make you Soldiers or permanent Adherents. Make great efforts to reach the Religious people, send out circulars to the Ministers, get the Reserved seats well to the front if you are going to have a Penitent-Form, and, above all, be sure to fix the hours of the meetings at such times that the Working people won't be able to attend unless they go without their Tea.

30. Make your Open-Airs short and lively. Have plenty of Choruses, and be sure and never give the words out, lest any strangers who may gather up to listen should know what it is you are singing. Keep the Testimonies "short and to the point," and without meaning, so that nothing may be said likely to affect anyone hanging around. The more alike these testimonies or speeches are one to the other, and the more commonly they are a repetition of what has been said in that place before, the better, If any addresses are made, the same rule will very much apply, but be sure not to talk much, if at all, yourself. Spare your throat, and keep what you have to say that is of importance for the Hall, where you can reckon to a dead certainty on having nobody present likely to be moved by your talk, all of them having heard, if not the same words, the same truth over and over again until they can stand anything. But if you do speak now and then in the Open-Air, mind and never get anything ready to say. Just take what comes up at the moment. Anything will do there.

31. Don't put yourself about, or be anxious whether your Corps prospers or not. Keep on quoting to yourself the passage, "All things work together for good," and take your food and your sleep with regularity, or else your health may come to grief. Avoid, on principle, the appearance of any great zeal or passion. Never be in haste. Take everything coolly.

32. If the After-Meeting, on Sunday, or any other Night, does not go with a bang and keep on lively, don't throw away your strength on the mere fag-end of things. Specially make this a rule if there is little help, and you feel a little extra tired. Why should you kill yourself on three or four hardened sinners, some of whom have been in that obstinate condition for a long time? Close up and leave the results with the Lord. Don't think or say or do anything desperate about their being lost. Encourage them to hope on and so proceed on their journey to the Bottomless Pit.

33. Don't talk about the Army much out of the meetings, and what you do say let it be exclusively about your own doings either in the past, present, or future. Seldom make any reference to what is being done by your comrades in other parts of the world, and when people are determined to discuss the Movement, you might bring in with good effect a reference to some of its breakdowns, or remark on what you think are its weaknesses, or show some points where other people have suggested possible improvements.

34. If audiences are small, and souls are not saved, and money is scarce, be sure and discover the reason for the same in the fact of the people in that district being hard and stupid, or more than ordinarily wicked, or justify the painful fact — to your own mind at least — by a reference to the conduct of a preceding Officer or something of the kind. But never, on any account, allow the dismal failure to be traceable to your own idleness, or want of tact, or want of Grace, or by putting it down to anything else you have done or left undone. In short, never lay the blame of failure on your own heart.

35. As to your talking, never fret yourself, or lose your rest, or disturb your mind about getting anything fresh to say, or by turning over your thoughts again and again so as to get them into a shape in which you feel sure they will go into the conscience and hearts of your hearers. And when you do stumble on any ideas, or facts, or good illustrations, never, on any account, be at the trouble to write them down, or wrestle with God for more light and point and power. That would not only be getting a sword ready for the ungodly, which is the truth of God, but getting it sharpened by the Holy Ghost.

36. Instead of all this anxiety and fluster, get a bit of an old address, or something you made up when you were at the Training Home, or two or three old anecdotes, and fix a text on to them. If you use an Outline or an illustration out of THE OFFICER. don't trouble to alter it so that it will suit your own mind or match your hearers. Just take it as it is, or leave it. And if you do take it as it is, don't be at the trouble to get its meaning well into your own soul. Don't on any account, be anxious, or do any extra praying or thinking about it. You have so often got through before, you never remember sticking fast in your life, and although you may have made a mess of it many a time in the past, nobody ever took much notice of it, and all will be well once more.

37. Don't read your "Soldier's Guide" with any conscientious regularity. Just pick out a few verses of your Bible here and there, and now and then, and that will suffice. Don't read anything Mrs. Booth, or The General, or other Staff Officers have written. Be sure and pass over all the solid and more thoughtful matter in The Officer, in the different War Crys, or other publications of the Army, and give a look at and scan the stories and general news of what is going on.

38. Read at least one Newspaper a day. Look over Tit Bits when you have a chance. Talk politics or discuss the last murder with anybody who will join you; or it you meet another Officer, have a good "go in" together about the hardships of your respective Corps. If you are a woman, you can comfortably get through the time that would otherwise hang heavily upon your hands by some gossip or other.

39. Avoid "All-Nights of Prayer" They upset the regularity of life, interfere with good habits of self-indulgence, and may be taken as being unfavorable, in a general way, to Health. Indeed, I advise you never to have "Half-Nights" even, or anything approaching to extraordinary efforts to promote Holiness, or the waking up of your Corps, or the Salvation of souls.

40. Meet your Local Officers as seldom as ever you can, and be careful not to take them into your confidence, or talk over with them the condition of your Corps, or consult with them as to any new Measures, or to join them in prayer and faith for greater victories and better days in the future.

41. Be sure and never have a proper Soldiers' Meeting, Regulation or no Regulation; or, if you do have such gatherings, use them merely for the purpose of pointing out the defects, neglects, and shortcomings of your people, and for scolding them on that account. It is true that Soldiers' Meetings may at times he useful, as presenting the opportunity for explaining Self-Denial or similar Financial efforts, or for what would be the most important of all, the defense of your own character. Then a Soldiers' Meeting may be regarded as absolutely necessary, because what is there in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, so important as the "Field Officer's" character, whatever the maintenance of it may cost?

42. Be sure and leave all the responsibility, and, as far as possible, all the work for the Juniors' War upon the hearts and shoulders of anybody who will undertake it, Whether equal to the task or not. It cannot be expected that you should be troubled with the Salvation of the Children, seeing what a number of more serious duties demand your care.

43. In harmony with the above, you should be careful to take as little notice as possible of the Children of your own people, or of the Children of the members of your audiences, or, indeed, of Children generally. To manifest any interest in the Children, specially to do anything promotive of their happiness or welfare, is one of the surest cuts you can take to the hearts of their parents; and as I am instructing you how most effectually to drive people off from you, I must caution you most seriously against doing anything which would be likely to gain for you their hearts, or open a likely way to secure the Salvation of their souls.

This concludes Part 2 of William Booth's satirical advice to Salvation Army field officers, published in February 1899. The piece continues his ironic method of teaching proper leadership principles by explicitly outlining counterproductive behaviors. Booth's mastery of reverse psychology and his deep understanding of human nature shine through in these detailed observations of how officers can sabotage their own ministry effectiveness.
