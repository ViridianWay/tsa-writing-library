**JANUARY, 1899**

**Being Some Counsels for the Field Captain Who Is Desirous of Not Succeeding in His Corps.**

Having many times in varying forms and different places laboured to show the Field Officer how he can succeed in his Command, it has seemed to me that my extended experience might enable me to suggest some methods which, if effectively set in motion, will be very likely to make him a Failure. I give them confident of their efficiency. They are none of them original, seeing that they have been known and practised by Field Officers over and over again in the past, and that with striking results. Still, they may not have come under the notice of all my Comrades, and I present them for their consideration, and such amongst them as are really anxious to let down Corps which the devotion, labours, and sacrifices of their predecessors have built up, and who may be desirous of driving out of the Kingdom precious souls for whom their Master died, will here find recipes which they can adopt and employ with a tolerably certain prospect of success.

I may, however, say here, that it is not necessary to follow all the methods here after described, or any considerable number of them, in order to gain the end aimed at. In some cases, one or two or three of the suggestions named, if only acted upon in a spirited manner, and followed up with vigour by a Captain, will work wonders in the way of destroying confidence, hindering the co-operation of his Soldiers, and building up on impassable barrier between him and the unconverted people around him, and of effectually closing the Heavens against any Pentecostal outpouring of the Spirit of God.

1. Begin your work by looking down on your Corps. Encourage yourself in thinking that it is not worthy of you. Mention this feeling to your Lieutenant, and to one or two of the Soldiers with whom you are first brought into contact. They will be sure to tell it again to others, and it will thereby come quickly into everybody's mouth.

2. As soon as you have opportunity after your arrival, begin to make unfavorable comparisons between your new Corps and the one you have just left — you might show the superiority of the Hall, or the Quarters, or the Band, and you might specially crack up the Soldiers — tell how kind they were to you and how much you loved them, and it would have a good effect if you added in a careless sort of manner that you wondered whether you were going to like your new Comrades as well as those you have just left behind you.

3. The first time you have only a few Soldiers with you in the Open-air, say to yourself loud enough for someone to hear you, "God help us! What sort of a concern is this?" That will have a good effect.

4. Tell the Soldiers at your very first opportunity that you believe in "a holy people," and that unless there is a change for the better with them you feel that nothing will be done. Or you might he able to hear something about the Town, or the Barracks, or the Finances, or something else with which you can find fault, in order effectually to discourage them and destroy any believing expectations they may have cherished in connection with the advent of their new Officers.

5. If you are a man, have a fancy that the Corps prefers a woman, or if you are a woman that a man would be most acceptable to the Corps, and be sure and say so on the first opportunity, or if you find out any little preferences that the Corps may have in the way of meetings, methods, etc., be sure you let them know that you have discovered their likings and that you consider that they only prove the weakness of those entertaining them.

6. If you follow a Captain who was useful and beloved, carefully avoid mentioning his name either publicly or privately, and by all means be sure and refrain from referring to the good work done during his command, and if you should happen to hear anything reflecting on his character or ability, be sure and talk about it. If he paid special attention to any particular form of labour, such as Visitation, the Juniors, or the like, let it be known at once that you don't go in for that kind of thing much yourself nor approve of so much fuss being made about that form of work by other Officers.

7. Be very particular to get at the business as soon as possible of finding out the inconsistencies of your Soldiers. Make them feel that you have a very high standard of morality, and that nobody need expect that they will stand well with you who have not a very clean record. You might with good effect let it be known that while you disapprove most strongly of backbiting amongst your Soldiers, that you don't object to them bringing you tales reflecting unfavorably on the characters of their comrades.

8. Deal very firmly with backsliders. Alas! you will find many of them. Make them realise that you regard their conduct with great aversion, and that you consider that little or no excuse can be found for it. If you visit them before their names come off the Roll according to Regulation, or talk to them in the Hall or elsewhere, be sure and make them feel that you consider them entirely to blame for the whole trouble. Don't allow that anyone else did them any wrong in the matter. This will make them sure that you are ignorant and hard-hearted, and effectually close their minds against being benefited by anything you do or say.

9. If the Corps is in debt make a good deal of the difficulty, and if you have come from a Corps that is in better circumstances, spread that out and glory in it. This should be carefully done during the first two or three Sundays. Make the people feel that you are not at fault in this matter. Dwell on it with gusto, rub it in, and make then feel their misfortune.

10. If the rent of the Hall is heavy, mention it as often as is convenient, and always contrive to say that the Divisional Assessments and the Headquarters Dues must be paid whatever comes.

11. Manage to occupy the most of the time and devote the largest portion of your energies in the Open-air to begging and always have at least two collections on the Sunday night.

12. If you have a large audience of poor and rough people, it will be a good plan to put a money admission at the doors. That will be almost certain to keep away the class who are most likely to be converted and make good and efficient Soldiers.

13. Keep your hall as dingy and as dirty as you reasonably can. Never open the windows between the meetings for ventilation. If there is a hole in the plaster where the War Cry Contents Bill or the Announcement of the Harvest Festival was nailed up, leave it, and make another. If the gas-globes and reflectors are dirty and smoky, on no account get a ladder and clean them. If a pane of glass is broken leave it, or patch a piece of brown paper on it. If a slate comes off, or a gutter gets closed with a birds nest or some rubbish, and the water comes through the ceiling, or trickles down the walls, don't touch it yourself beyond occasionally making a joke about it.

14. Pay no attention to the outside of your Hall. Avoid, as far as possible, anything like paint, or soap and water, however cheap, or labour however willing the Soldiers may be to give it. Don't have any Notice Boards alongside your doors,or, if there are such things, never have them cleansed. Leave the old bills flapping about, whether on the boards or on the walls. They will give a mature and ancient aspect to the place and show how independent of appearances you are, or think you are.

15. Never put up the announcements for Sunday's meetings till the Thursday, or even Friday. You might even drive it on to Saturday. I have known Officers who have deferred the same till Sunday, and that with fine effect.

16. In your intercourse with your Soldiers, there are two methods which may be followed with equal probabilities of success. One is to keep yourself as much as possible to yourself. Carry your head high end keep everybody at arms length as though you were some superior person. That will make them draw off from you and leave you to fight it out alone. Or secondly, you can make yourself everybody's companion — talking, laughing, joking with all alike. That plan will shake the confidence of the best of your people in your sense and your religion, and effectually destroy the respect of all.

17. In your Visitation confine yourself to your Soldiers only, attending chiefly to those who like you the best, are the most respectable, and live the nearest to your Quarters. When you visit them or the Soldiers generally, spend the time mostly in chatter about the affairs of the Corps, or about the Soldiers, or the general gossip of the place. Don't put any questions about personal Salvation, such Holiness, the Love of souls, the Conversion of other members of the family and the like, and if you can generally manage to get away without prayer everybody will see that you only visit because it is a part of the work you do for a living and not for the love of God and souls.

18. In visiting you should never call on the Ungodly unless you are sent for. Don't hunt out the Sick in the neighborhoods where you hold your Open-airs or where your Soldiers live. Never go to the Public-houses or move about among the crowds on Saturday nights or on Market Days selling your War Crys, and talking to anybody and everybody with whom you have a chance about Salvation and Eternity. Push yourself on the attention of the people who are friendly with the Army, for they may esteem you personally; that is, keep on good terms and well in view of the friendly people in the town, but don't bother about the unfriendlies.

This satirical piece represents Part 1 of William Booth's ironical counsel to Salvation Army field officers, published in January 1899. Through reverse psychology, Booth effectively outlines what officers should NOT do, thereby teaching proper leadership principles by highlighting their opposites. The article demonstrates Booth's practical wisdom and understanding of common leadership failures within The Salvation Army's corps structure.
