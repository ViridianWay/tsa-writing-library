# How to Keep Souls to the Front

_September-October, 1896_

## AN INTERVIEW WITH THE GENERAL

That the General was, of course, very busy, goes without saying. In the simply-furnished working-room of his quarters at Hadley Wood he sat at a little table against the window, rapidly writing, letter-baskets, labelled "Officers and Soldiers," and a variety of Salvation Army affairs were arranged on another table, and bristled with papers. Even in detail the General evidently organizes and manages this vast Army with workmanlike skill. There is no higgledy-piggledy muddle, but the impressiveness of order. Indeed, the whole scene is strangely military. The simple furniture and plain, soldierly arrangements savor of Wellington in the lines of Torres Vedras.

And the General, just back from a mighty campaign in the West of England, is asleep? — off for a six months' rest to Palestine? — or, perchance, the Rivera? Nothing of the sort; he has a practical religion that is as strongly centered on a Monday as on a Sunday, on the great business of his life,

### DRIVING SIN OUT OF THE WORLD,

That God may have His own again. But though the General might well be weary, and the pressure of business is tremendous, this Army, the great living, moving creation of the Divine Spirit, cannot dawdle to discuss or dabble in outside affairs — it must go on. And the General, as one in whose mind sounds eternally the lofty words and high principles of the Cross itself, how shall he take life but as a stern, fierce battle with wrong? So he ever cries, "Sound the trumpet call: 'Advance!'"

I announced the purport of the visit, and propounded the question on which light was asked from the General. Was it possible for an F.O., surrounded with his many cares and duties, to ever keep soul-saving to the front?

The mention of THE OFFICER evidently touched a sore spot in the General's mind, and brought out the fact, with considerable emphasis, that he was almost in absolute despair with respect to it.

I inquired in what particular he was troubled. He replied that to make this magazine a means of inspiration had been one of the choicest purposes of his literary enterprises; and now, alas! he was afraid that it would prove a failure — indeed, he was in despair with respect to it.

"But the General must keep up, if all else fail!

### "WHAT CAN BE WRONG?"

Here the General marched the room, pausing to say, "They tell me THE OFFICER isn't read; that Officers glance at the General's and Chief's articles (a complimentary admission, of course), scan the pages for news, profoundly study the appointments and marriages, and pass the remainder by with utter indifference.

"But there's a remedy"—the General's soul glanced through his eyes. "Am I to conclude that one of my pet schemes is to fail? I cannot, owing to the vastness of the Army, speak to my Officers as frequently as I'd like, but cannot THE OFFICER be a means of profitable intercourse? However," continued the General "the subject is —?"

"How," I asked, "shall an Officer in the midst of a hundred varied duties and anxieties keep a keen yearning for souls?"

The General paused and leaned back in his chair. "A vast subject," said he; "a great business. Requires a book of three volumes to sufficiently answer it. I might – but there, I am wandering off. To keep souls to the front, he must have the soul-saving purpose immovably fixed in the centre of his own soul. All he does will be to the great end."

"Suppose, General that the F.O. is engaged in the common-place duty of paying his gas-bill, will that duty present him with the opportunity of helping forward his soul-saving desires?"

"Certainly it will! The cashier who received his money may be a worthy fellow or not, and the various clerks and accountants may all be totally indifferent to religion—but when they see his uniform, they will know that

### "IT IS A MAN OF GOD

that has come. The cashier will expect some word to be dropped, and the Officer will have the opportunity, as he hands him his money, to remark on the importance of light in things heavenly as well as earthly, together with a hint as to the danger of working in darkness, both in this world and in the world to come. Tact, thought, an apt way of getting in the truth, many lead the cashier who received the money, and who is made much the same as other men, to God Himself."

"Then, with you, General, the secular is religious, and the religious is secular?"

"Exactly. Why not? Oh, this everlasting distinction between things alleged to be spiritual, and to be secular. A man with a keen relish for soul-saving whose heart bubbles over at a full penitent-form, is not doing a secular act in begging for a Self-Denial Fund or a Harvest Festival, in settling a personal difficulty, or writing an advertisement for his barracks' front. It's all in the Kingdom. He is equally bent on souls in all of it — put that down clearly now. And by the way, let's have all our writings simple and plain. What words you fellows do put in your papers. 'Esculent.' The Chief and I were looking at that wonderful word in the Gazette yesterday. And 'categorical.' Why 'esculent'? Are there no simpler words than these? I asked a thoroughly educated man to give the exact meaning of 'esculent,' and he could not — without a dictionary. But there — oh, you journalists!

"But come, now, I want to say emphatically that an Officer on fire for souls does all his work in the soul-saving spirit, and does not lose that spirit because he cannot be every moment praying with penitents.

### "THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU."

"Do you think, General, that the study of books helps an Officer to keep souls to the front?"

"Obviously, any book that is of a Divine stamp must fan the holy fire that burns in the Officer's bosom. But let him beware. The bulk of literature, secular or religious, makes no pretence of being written under holy influences. Salvation from sin is a thing almost unmentioned, except in a goody-goody, abstract, dreamy fashion. But any Field Officer may read to be inspired or to learn how better to do his work, if he only gets the right stuff to read."

"What do you think of an Officer making preparation for the platform, General? The Field Officer will be highly interested to have your opinion thereon. Will not one Officer say, 'I don't want to preach.' "

"Certainly," replied the General, "it ought be so; an orthodox dry preachment is abhorrent. It means death, not life. Still, one may reasonably consider the needs of one's congregation and settle beforehand the general lines of an address calculated to hit and a convict. We think it right to consider a good position for a barracks, or the best stands for Open-airs, or the best methods of Corps management. Why should we not plan beforehand the best methods of convicting and instructing our hearers?"

"Is it not so with

### "ALL ARMY ORGANIZATION,

"General?"

"Transparently so. Common sense says, 'Look where you are going. Make the best of your time and chance; not by striking hitty-missy, but by judicious forethought.' You choose sergeants, arrange collections, all with consideration, and, personally, my first thoughts with a crowd are, 'What are these people?' 'How shall I direct my arrows?' 'How can I best bring them down to the Cross?' And in the light of the Spirit I do my best. But that is not to hinder my preparing a general idea of what I shall say. Nay, the one helps the other. Combine thought and prayer, and do your utmost, and processed of all this, 'Keep souls to the front, and God shall give the increase."

"This method has helped you, General, in your own great revivals of old, as well as your present great soul-saving campaigns?"

"Yes. It will help all, I believe; indeed, I see no other way. We may occasionally adopt variations in details, but how else shall an Officer succeed than by being holy, devoted, and skillful?"

"But how shall an officer, much burdened with finances, keep souls first, General?"

"Surely, he shall raise his money, by God's blessing, in the same Hallelujah spirit! The condition of his soul does not depend on the peculiarities of his work. As I say, nothing is 'secular' to him. It is all with the burning zeal for souls that he

### "STRUGGLES TO PAY HIS WAY.

"Let him not be downcast, but rely on God, who will look upon his heart, and sustain there an ever-flowing fountain of love for souls. I grant the hollowness of all industry that does not actually bring men to God, but is not the financing of the war part of soul saving effort? Yes, it must be so."

"Suppose, General, that an Officer gets only a few people inside his barracks, and has a 'hard go,' getting a few folks round the open-air, and not much beside?"

"If the people won't come to the Office, the Officer must go to the people. If he is consumed by a passion for their souls, he will reach them somehow; if not in the barracks, in the streets; if not in the streets, in their cottages; if not in groups and congregations, then one by one. If he has the Holy Ghost, and is a genuine Salvationist, he will 'go for souls' outside of all ruts and conventionalities. And if he aims to get them, then get them he will.

### "AND TO SUSTAIN THAT PASSION

"God will help him. God does help. How wonderfully," the General went on, "the Spirit can take hold of the mind and direct it exactly to the spot needed. And He will help all, burdened with finance or not. And I should like to see the Officer who is more burdened therewith than the General."

The shades of night were falling and the sparrows had gone from the little grass-plot in front of the window alongside which we were sitting, ere the sun's last sloping gleams had died away. There sat the General, with all the burdens of the Salvation Army upon his shoulders. Nay, more, shall we not say that the prophet of God, whom we honor and reverence as our General, does not bend beneath the weight of the sorrows and sins of the wide world?

How should I press him with the problems — smaller they seemed now than before — of the Salvation Field?

But the General went on, in a reverie — "if the Officer keep a conscience void of offense, if he will watch and pray, God will sustain him in his passion for souls. It shall be a habit with him to seek them; part of himself, which he will find there

### "WITHOUT ANY 'FETCHING UP.'

"The opportunity will mean the victory. My great aim in a meeting is to get the people into my net. A man goes shooting birds — he does his best to bring them down. He goes fishing, and he pitches upon likely pools, and uses the most suitable rods and baits to catch his fish. What if he shoots, and hits no birds? What if he fishes, and catches no fish? And what if he goes home contented with such an experience?

"Oh, the great evil, spiritually," cried the General, pacing to and fro — "the great evil is setting down to shooting and hitting nothing, to fishing and catching nothing: to having a fair crowd, a pretty satisfactory meeting, and going on in a species of 'reasonable contentment.'"

"Then, General, you think that in all an Officer's dealings with a congregation he should never rest contented without actual conversions?"

"Yes; and I strongly inset that all people should be strongly impressed that it is a terrible thing to stop short of a thorough work — the attainment of the actual salvation of those he deals with. The temptation is to avoid hurting the feelings of nice, kind, but yet unsaved people, who give to the collection, who help the Harvest Festival, and are as willing to lend the F.O. a hand as his own Soldiers. The Officer who 'keeps souls to the front' will drive the Sword of the Spirit into their hearts, regardless of their feelings, and destroy the illusion that anything can take the place of being washed in the Blood of the Lamb and living the holy life of a warrior saint."

"Perhaps General, an Officer reasons, 'If I deal too faithfully, I shall lose so and-so, who gives liberally.' "

"Possibly. Indeed, I believe many get into such bondage, but there is no need. Because, in most cases, whether the aforesaid giver benefits or not, time will prove that he admires honest dealing, especially when they believe it is the

### "OUTCOME OF PURE LOVE

"for their souls. And if one friend is lost by thorough work, another will be gained. But the Officer must always keep before his mind that the making of friends, the getting of money, the creating of kindly feelings in the outside world, do not constitute the end of his mission. His work is to represent God, to interpret God's truth and purposes, to save men and women from sin and hell, and to make good Soldiers of Jesus Christ.

"These," said the General, sinking back in his chair, and taking up a huge pile of correspondence — "these must be the purposes of an F.O. from morning till night, in all circumstances and places, and then — God will make him a flame of fire and a power for good wherever he goes."

This intimate interview, conducted in Booth's study at Hadley Wood in September-October 1896, provides remarkable insights into the General's philosophy of ministry and leadership. The conversational format reveals both Booth's practical wisdom and his passionate commitment to soul-winning as the central purpose of all Salvation Army activity.

The interview addresses a perennial challenge for religious leaders: how to maintain spiritual focus amid the pressing administrative and financial demands of organizational leadership. Booth's response is characteristically holistic—he rejects the sacred/secular divide, arguing that everything an officer does should be infused with soul-winning purpose.

Particularly striking is Booth's emphasis on results-oriented ministry. His hunting and fishing metaphors reveal his expectation that officers should never be content with "reasonable satisfaction" without actual conversions. This results-focused approach, combined with his rejection of the fear of offending financial supporters, demonstrates the uncompromising nature of his evangelistic vision.

The document also reveals Booth's concern about officer engagement with "The Officer" magazine, showing his ongoing efforts to maintain connection with his growing army of workers through written communication when personal contact became impossible due to the organization's scale.
