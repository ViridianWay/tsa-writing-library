# The General on Leadership

_July, 1894_  
_Edited by: Commissioner Booth-Tucker_

---

You are all Leaders, or destined to be. You may be, if you will; you are more or less so now, and there is no knowing the number of men you may have to control, hearts to fashion, and destinies to shape before you slip off this mortal coil. You are Leaders, and you are Leaders of men.

To be a Leader in the vegetable world is of considerable moment. To be able to turn the wilderness into a garden, and make 'the desert blossom as the rose,' is an important task. Somebody says that he who makes two blades of grass grow where only one grew before has served his generation well.

To be a Leader in the mineral world is an important business. To take the gold and silver as they are found in the bowels of the earth and mould and fashion them for the service of mankind; to dive into the depths of the sea and get pearls to adorn the diadems of the great; to take hold of those minerals that are useful for making locomotives and furnishing fires to carry on the business of the world is also an important undertaking; to be a Leader in the commercial world in the shipping interest, are in buying, selling, and exchanging articles of value — these are all important matters.

But to be a Leader of men; to control and fashion; to take hold of the bodies and minds and souls of men is far more important; for man is the noblest work of God so far as this world goes — and other worlds too, so far as we know. He was made a little lower than the angels — that had reference possibly to his position rather than his character — and if he had only gone forward on the lines of growth and expansion as he was intended to do, and kept to his integrity, we cannot tell but that he might have come close up to the Throne of God Himself. "I said ye are gods," is a sort of prophecy. By Christ we may rise and get back that forfeited position near the Throne of God.

To lead Man — this noble being who has been accounted so great and who can be made so noble is, then, a great matter. To lead men merely in the human sense in politics is important and a distinction much sought after. Some of the greatest minds that have ever lived have sacrificed all they had in order to gain a position of leadership amongst those who form the laws of man. To be a leader of men in governing a state, to sit upon a throne and rule the destinies of mankind, is important; but to be a leader of men in the Salvation of the world, to control the hearts and minds of men, and lead them back from the abyss of damnation, from their lives of sin Heavenward, until you land them alongside the Throne of Jehovah — not only individually, but in masses — is infinitely more important. In this great Salvation War, to be one of God's Generals and attack the battalions of Hell that usurp the government of Heaven is the most important task of all.

Leadership of men is desirable for many reasons. I quite agree with the Apostle, and understand him when he says, "If any man desire the office of a bishop he desires a good thing." It is perfectly lawful if your motives are pure and free from any desire to fulfill your own ambition. A true Leader uses every legitimate means to reach the position for which God intended him, and which he is qualified to fill. There is something agreeable in being a Leader. True, there are burdens attached to the position. A good Leader bears no small measure of anxiety. He sheds tears, he has wakeful nights of watching, and while his followers wrap themselves in their cloaks and sleep calmly till morning, the Leader paces his tent through the night beneath the burden of his responsibility. He sees the bearings of the struggle and feels that the destiny of thousands hang upon his word. The Leader suffers more, perchance a thousand times more, than the man who lies on the ground with his fractured limbs, or who pours out his blood upon the green sward.

But in spite of this, when a man is a *bona fide* Leader, he experiences a sensation which is next to the sensation of divinity in controlling crowds of people whom he inspires and sends forth. Though loss should follow and ruin dog his footsteps, nevertheless, he is certain that if he is faithful, one day he will have his reward, and meanwhile he has the consciousness of victory in his soul. The charm and satisfaction attaching to a Leader far more than outweighs the anxieties and crushing defeats which he may encounter. In a real war Leaders die daily. I confess to you I can understand the meaning of Paul when he says, "I die daily." There are times when night after night the horizon is clouded, and when, shut out as it were from the very presence of Jehovah the Leader cries, "My God, my God, 'why hast Thou forsaken me?" you can also understand it. Jesus Christ died many times in that sense before the breaking of His heart and the giving up the ghost.

To be a Leader is to have a power for good over man and thereby to have your own power multiplied. How important is it then that we should individually seek to discharge our responsibilities as in the sight of God! I have no sympathy with the hang-dog, do-my-duty, give-satisfaction-to-my-employers spirit. Hold up your head and say "I am going to do my work — the work which Thou, my God, hast given me to do; I must work while it is day."

Another point which seems to make it so desirable to be a Leader of the hosts of God on earth must be the contact which such a man enjoys with his great LEADER in the sky. There must be intimate association between the Leader and his General in earthly matters. Just so must the relation apply to Divine things. How honorable, then, is such a position of Leadership, and how important is it that a Leader of the Army of the Lord of Hosts should lead well and be a man such as God can trust and bless!

One of the great dangers of a Salvationist is to underestimate his own position. He is apt to take himself at the price which is set upon him by the outside world about him. The less he reads their newspapers and the jangle of the religious press, the better. It seems to me that a large mass of religious leaders — and I say this without anything but pity in my heart — are blind leaders of the blind, and when they compliment us their compliments are so joined to complaints that there is a question whether, after all, they are a blessing or the reverse. I should say that the thinkers in the Christian world, at least those who have any knowledge of The Salvation Army, are not in reality sorry for us, but for themselves. If we could read their real feelings, they must regret being connected with the Antiquated Associations to which they belong. They must feel themselves to be very much in the position of ivy growths that hold their hoary walls together, and if they attempt to mend them the whole of the structure will go to the ground. They are sorry, doubtless, they cannot go over their lives again. Some of the greatest thinkers of the day all over the world have expressed themselves thus of The Salvation Army and the inferiority of their own institutions. At any rate, whether they have this feeling or not, it is in this light that I would have you regard the position and responsibilities God has entrusted to you. Estimate that position at its true worth.

I feel towards you as though you were a Bench of Bishops, a Congress of Notabilities. If God bases any hopes on any one for the salvation of the world, it must be on The Salvation Army. If we are unfaithful, God will take away our candlestick out of its place. There are quite enough lifeless organizations in the world without our adding one more. I hope God will sweep it off the face of the earth if it should ever become so!

What sort of individual, and what sort of character should the Leader possess? In the first place he must be capable of inspiring confidence in those whom he seeks to control. He must be a man who can make people believe in him, not so much because of the rightness of what be says, as because of his influence. He will inspire them so that they will feel no disposition to argue. You know how this spirit is going out of the world. Men now will know the reason for everything. True Leadership is passing away, or only expressing itself in the Radical gabble of the Democratic rabble. The influence of the true Leader is the reverse of the spirit of the age. When he speaks the people believe him and go to fulfill his commands and more or less worship him, but it is based on the love of him. It was thus with the great Napoleon. I never read of such men as Caesar, Napoleon, and Frederick the Great, but that I envy them the power they had to inspire their followers, who knew they had nothing to gain; they only knew the man, gloried in him, followed him and died for him.

If these Leaders were able to inspire such love, what ought we not to be able to inspire in our followers in seeking to bring them into acquaintance with the peace and joy of Heaven? The Leader should be a man who can inspire such confidence and affection as is exemplified by one of Napoleon's old soldiers, who, when he was lying in a hospital in Paris, as the surgeon was probing his breast for a bullet, said, "A little deeper, doctor, and you will find the Emperor in my heart."

Again, the true Leader ensures imitation. He multiplies heroes. That was the way Napoleon made Generals so great that people said his victories were won, not by his own, but by the genius of his Generals. But who made the Generals? The great Napoleon himself; and if they were great, so much greater the credit, humanly speaking, to the Emperor. When I say the true Leaders ensures imitation, I do not mean mere outward copies, but men after his own kind, like the plant which produces seed after its own kind.

The true Leader instils courage. I don't know if I am quite correct, but it is said that if it were only whispered among the troops that Napoleon had come on the field, this was worth more than a reinforcement of twenty thousand men. The bare fact that Napoleon was there made every man as a lion. Battles are fought not by shouts, not by numbers, not so much by ability, as by courage and daring. David dared go against Goliath. He had only a sling and a stone, simple weapons, and handy enough, but it was the courage of the little beggar — of the boy whom his brothers looked down up when they said he had come to see the battle out of the naughtiness of his heart — that did it. I have no sympathy with the weak-kneedness that tries to get behind another, or hide itself behind the coat-tails of a Commissioner, in order to shirk responsibility. There are some who, if it is to be a victory, are ready enough to come forward, but if it is to be a defeat, to get put into the "Sun" or "Pall Mall Gazette," they want to throw their responsibility on to some one else. I think it is mostly the men, not the women officers who do this. The women rather come to the front at such times, and encourage the men at dark moments to hold on and go forward. The man who is going to win is the man who says, "I can do it."

The true Leader *makes* men sacrifice. They delight to die for him. How foreign is this to the spirit of the age which says: "I must have so much money in order to live and enjoy myself!" The spirit of Jesus Christ says, "You must sacrifice, give away, lose, bleed, and die." I would to God you could see it that the men and women who have the capacity to make their people willing to suffer and serve and take the lowest place at the feast, do most for God and the salvation of a dying world!

## Qualifications for Leadership

I would now like to name some qualifications that go to make the Leader. What should there be in you to make you a successful Leader? If it is not in you, it will not come out of you. Putting on uniform, taking a position, drawing a salary and strutting about, as some officers do, in their Sunday clothes, and not much else — these things will not make such a Leader as I have spoken of.

I am going to speak of seven qualifications — I might go on to speak of seventy, but I will confine myself to seven — without which you cannot be a powerful Leader of men in The Salvation Army.

### A Leader Must Love

Undoubtedly the first and most important of these is Love. I do not know a chapter in the Bible that is more important, when you came to a definition of what true religion is, and which is less talked about, read, pondered over and understood, than the 13th chapter of 1st Corinthians, which describes Charity. That is true religion. There is no other religion. There are other things that pass for it, but there is no other Christianity. If you do not love, you are not a Salvationist, you are not a Christian, you are not an heir to glory, you are not a worker of wonders.

Now, there are three sorts of Love. First, there is the Love of Instinct, which is no credit to any person: it is no credit for a woman to love her child, to suffer for it, to watch over it, and more than it is to eat and drink. The love of instinct is the natural passion of the heart. Take, for instance, the love of children to parents, and brothers to sisters. There is not too much of that in the world nowadays. Nevertheless, these human loves are loves of instinct.

Then there is the Love of Interest. Many men love their wives, and wives their husbands, because of the circumstances they are in, and because their own welfare and happiness are wrapped up in them.

Finally, there is the Love of Benevolence, which has to do with the deliberate choice of the soul, and arises from holy, heavenly, beneficent motives. This sort of love looks upon the saint and the sinner with a passionate longing. The love of Christ and souls makes you turn your back upon the love of instinct and interest, because you are inspired to do so by God Himself, and this love becomes a Divine instinct.

### A Leader Must Have Ability

Again, the Leader who is to succeed must have a certain amount of Ability; none of your leveling down principles and socialistic rot, which seeks to alter the Divine order of things, can possibly change this. As one star differs from another star in glory, so shall it be in the Resurrection Morning; it is so in Heaven, it will be so in Hell. You can wish it to be otherwise, but the fact remains, and I very much question whether in your own case you would wish to level down. It may seem all very well from the Have-nots' point of view, who, without labor and without sweat of brow or brain say, "We are going to have regulations which will bring those who have brains on to a level with those who have none, and those who toil on to a level with those who are idle." If such equality could be established, where would it be tomorrow? To say men are born equal is a thundering lie! Such a notion may be all very well for ordinary times, but in the presence of a common danger, the first thing men do is to turn their eyes to the man who is capable of leading them. In the French Revolution they made the streets swim with blood in trying to level down, but Napoleon came in and put his heel upon the whole thing. Dangers and emergencies are always arising, and the true instincts of the human heart always seek the Leader out.

When I talk about capacity in Leaders, I do not mean that a man who leads must possess superior abilities in every respect to those who follow. There are comparatively few all-round men of superior capacity who shine in everything. But true ability manifests itself in recognizing ability in those we lead, and seeking to put them up in their right places; then they will in turn recognize the superiority of the man who recognized capacity in them.

### A Leader Must Be Courageous

There is, however, one quality which is essential in a man who is to be a Leader, and that is — Courage. A man may have capacity — ability to measure the stars, and dive into the bowels of the earth to find out its treasures, or to discover the wonderful properties of electricity, to acquire languages, to speak with the tongue of a seraph alongside the throne, or ability to do twenty other things; but there is something more than all this, and that is — the big, brave soul inside the man. The man with a courageous soul makes all the little stars wane before him. He may be a man of stammering speech and comparatively poor abilities, but the man who can stand up in the hour of danger is the man with a soul. That must be capacity. Other things being equal, the man who has courage does not wince in a time of danger. There is a certain amount of tears and faint-heartedness allowed, but it must be all out of sight. The washing of the dirty linen is allowable, but it must be carried on in private.

### A Leader Must Be Just

Another quality of a Leader must be Justice.

I know people who are great lovers, who are not Just people. They go about saying, "Dear brother, dear sister, I am sorry for your trials, but you know I am not the Commissioner; I hope you will have a fair chance." The true Leader is a man who speaks the truth; he swears to his own hurt and changes not. If you have sworn contrary to justice, go back and confess it. The man who speaks the truth, acts the truth, and makes everybody about him do the same. He would rather have the humiliation of confession at times that he had been wrong than always say, "You are wrong and I am right."

If you were to have a secret feeling in your soul that we were not just, fair and square, what would be the result? Why it would hamstring your resolution and destroy your confidence and devotion! The big heart full of love eschews evil, sets its face against wrong-doing and recognizes no duplicity in anybody else. Regarding a man like this, people say, "I want no Committees, no Court-Materials, no Inquiries! What he says, I will obey."

### A Leader Must Have God

A Leader must be a Believer. He must be a possessor of the Divine. God must be with him and in him. A man may be a leader in politics, in commerce, in fortune-making, in pleasure-seeking, in writing books, in oratory, in benevolence and all other things put together, independently of God; but if he is going to lead men in holiness, in the fight against sin and the devil, he must have God in his own soul. How could I send my child to India unless I know that the God of India was going with her? Just in proportion as you feel you have God — go to bed with Him, get up with Him, know Him, feel Him, walk with Him, make a food of yourself for Him — can you say, "I am a fool in Your service. Make my folly to do more than my wisdom."

You Staff Officers are people who have got on the ladder. You have climbed out of circumstances; and comparing your position with his own the Field Officer may say, "I toil out of sight, otherwise I should get promoted to be a Staff Officer." And he turns to International Headquarters and says, in the language of the Sunday-school song, "What must it be to be there!" "How many a flower is born to blush unseen!" Here, if you have abilities, you can expense them and fill us with admiration and make us send you out to India to die of cholera! What opportunities you have of distinguishing yourself!

### A Leader Must Be Industrious

Some people consider that geniuses are born; that Leaders are born, not made. I admit that there must be some qualifications, but after all said done, ability is acquired; genius is the capacity to acquire. If a man will but work, he can get to know. The Psalmist says, "I have never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread." I can say that I have never seen the industrious begging bread.

### A Leader Must Be Consecrated

Then, again, you can acquire Consecration. When a man says, "I will lay myself and everything I have out for the good of my fellows," he has taken the first great step in becoming a Leader of men. How often we see behind the scenes what fools men are. They are perhaps just about to be raised to a grand position of usefulness, when something comes out, showing that why are not really consecrated, and destroys our confidence. On the other hand, crowds of fully consecrated men in The Salvation Army, although not possessing the same ability, have never given us cause to question their devotion, and have never allowed one cloud to come between them and us. They are true simple souls who have just got God's glory and the good of their fellow men before their eyes, and consequently they seek not their own. And in forgetting themselves, others round about them have sought to secure for them the happiness which they would not seek for themselves.

I am your General, your friend, your father, and though I may not exactly feel towards you individually as I do to my own children, still, as you know, I leave them to take their chance along with you as it falls to them in the providence of God. I send them, as I do you, to their God-given posts, and leave them to bear the full weight of their cross. My father's heart would prompt me to shield you and them from the suffering that this entails; but this I cannot do.

To accomplish your work, treat yourself as men treat their horses — take care of them, that you may get as much work as possible out of them. Do this with your mind and heart and you can do a great deal of hard work. Ability to work grows and expands with its use. There more you do the more you can do. Take what food and sleep you body requires, and draw the line at that. Keep your soul in good order before God and man. I do more work now that ever I did in my life. I work longer hours, write more letters, and papers for the "Cry," and do more talking, as those about me can testify. Still, I do feel the infirmities of age creeping on, and have a good many aches and pains. I have had many difficulties and troubles; still, they have made the joy and pleasure I find in God and my work greater, and I should never have been where I am now — on a pinnacle before the eyes of the world and looked upon as a benefactor of mankind — but by sticking to the penitent form and by simple faith in God. After that, I attribute my success to night and day hard work.

If you want to be a Leader of men, work your brain. Keep doing what you have to do again and again, until you have perfected yourself in doing it.

## Above All, You Must Be a Believer

You must have a Pentecost — you must always be having Pentecosts — always having food for your soul. Some of you get seven meals a day and a good many cups of tea in-between. How many good solid meals does your soul get — not mere snacks? How often have you a judgment day on yourself? Paul says, "Judge yourself, lest you be judged." Once a week, at least, you ought to do it. Say to yourself, "Come, my soul! No shams! Let us have the truth out!"

Is the sky clear? Have you got the witness? Do you feel the Divine favor? Is everything right between you and God? How have you been dealing with those round about you? Have you been doing your work or shirking it? Have you been doing it as if your superior officers were about? Jesus Christ is your Master, and if the Carpenter did His work faithfully, you ought to do yours the same, and not merely consider what you are to get for it. That is the doctrine of Social Democrats. I say this for the benefit of the Democrats here! Paul says you are not to serve with eye-service, but to please God. Put in your full time. Your Heavenly Master will in good measure make up what you suffer.

If you will be sincere, if you will turn your full face to Him, He will turn to you. If you have not done so before, do it now, and say, "Blessed Father, I have not though of Your glory in doing Your work, but I want to." and He will make your hearts glad, and you shall go down to your graves with honor, and your children shall rise up and call you blessed, and your name shall be as ointment poured forth; and by the grace of God I shall meet you there, and we shall have the best time that has ever been known.

This comprehensive leadership address from July 1894 represents William Booth's mature understanding of leadership principles during The Salvation Army's period of global expansion. Delivered to staff officers at International Headquarters and edited by Commissioner Booth-Tucker, the document outlines Booth's philosophy that spiritual leadership requires both natural ability and divine empowerment. His seven qualifications for leadership—love, ability, courage, justice, divine connection, industry, and consecration—reflect his belief that effective Christian leadership demands both practical competence and spiritual depth. The frequent references to Napoleon and military leadership demonstrate Booth's conviction that The Salvation Army required the same level of strategic thinking and personal sacrifice as secular military campaigns, but directed toward spiritual conquest rather than territorial gain.
