# What is the Salvation Army?

_August, 1882_

---

As the person who has had perhaps the best possible opportunity of knowing all about the Salvation Army, I can most positively state that nobody invented it, that it has been evolved out of no man's brain, produced by no man's scheming, and is never likely to answer any man's own purpose - seeing that it has sprung into existence in a wholly unexpected way, and has already attained proportions and influence that place it utterly beyond the power of any one man to design or control its future.

Some seventeen years ago I came to London almost a stranger to its vast artisan population. I saw that they were without God, and I began in one of the great East End thoroughfares to do what I could as a preacher of the Gospel for their salvation. I had already had sixteen years' experience as a Methodist minister, and had been privileged to see so many thousands of hearts subdued beneath the power of the old-fashioned Gospel, that I was certain it only needed to be brought to bear upon these outlying masses to prove its efficiency for the salvation of the very worst of them. But how to get at them with it, that was the question; and upon that question, be it well understood, we consider we are still at work, for each success attained serves but as an incentive to seek for more and as a guide how to attain more.

I have not been disappointed. The old Gospel from the very first produced the old results. In a very few weeks after I took my stand, Bible in hand, amongst the jeering crowds of the Mile End Road, I had around me a valiant company of witnesses for Christ, recruited from amongst these masses, and the little one has steadily grown through all the seventeen years' of conflict up to the present Army, with its 320 corps, its 760 officers entirely employed in the work, its 6,200 services every week, its audiences of thousands and tens of thousands, generally the largest regularly gathered in any town it enters, and in most cases overtaxing the capacity of the largest buildings that can be secured.

During those years we have had to unlearn and learn a great deal, and to all the lessons of our experience the world is more than welcome. As I have already intimated, we do not pretend as yet to have finished our education. War is a wonderful schoolmaster, and he is unworthy of the name of a soldier who does not continually seek to learn from foes, as well as from friends, how most completely and rapidly to conquer. We have trusted in no human wisdom or power, but in the living God; and whilst we set down to His glory everything of success in the past, we encourage ourselves in Him to look for far greater things than these yet to be shown us in the future.

As to our doctrines, however, let me boldly say we have never imagined there was anything new to be learnt, and have no expectation of ever learning anything new. "The word of the Lord liveth and endureth for ever." We have not a particle of sympathy with those who would seek to tone down, or in any way to adapt the Gospel of Christ to suit the fancy of the nineteenth century.

The old-fashioned Gospel that tells man he is thoroughly bad and under the power of the devil, that drags out the very hidden things of iniquity to the light of the great judgment throne, that denounces sin without mercy, and warns men of eternal wrath to come, unless they repent and believe in the only Saviour; the Gospel whose goodness does not consist in the suppression of all but sweet sounds of love, but in the plain straightforward ceaseless announcement of the whole truth; the Gospel of a crucified Saviour who shed real blood to save men from a real guilt and a real danger of a real hell, and who lives again to give a real pardon to the really penitent, a real deliverance from the guilt and power and pollution and the fact of sin to all who really give up to Him a whole heart and trust Him with a perfect trust - such is the gospel of the Salvation Army.

We believe the three creeds of the Church with all our heart. We believe every word of the Commination Service, and we go about announcing the wrath of God against sinners just as people must who really believe that all these things are true. We have often been reproached, in fact, because we dwell so much upon what are often called "dark" truths, instead of joining in the popular chorus of excuse for iniquity, and sweetness and love for everybody; but we believe the greatest possible kindness to a man who is doing wrong and going to hell is to tell him so in the plainest and most urgent language that can be used. Once stopped and turned from his evil way, he will soon find out for himself all the loveliness of the great salvation.

We teach men to expect salvation from the guilt of sin the moment that, turning from it to God, they trust Him to receive and pardon them. We teach the new convert that God is able and willing perfectly to purge his heart from all its evil tendencies and desires the moment the soul, longing for this perfect deliverance from sin, trusts Him for it all. We urge the people not to rest until God has thus cleansed the thought of their hearts by the inspiration of His Holy Spirit, so that they may perfectly love Him and worthily magnify His holy name. And we assure them that no matter how severely they may be tempted, how full of frailty and liable to error and to falling away they may be in themselves, God will preserve them blameless, and cause them everywhere to triumph as long as they fully trust and obey Him.

We teach that sin is sin, no matter who commits it, and that there cannot be sin without Divine displeasure, even if it be in His own children. And we teach that there is a real, constant, and perfect deliverance from sin provided by the Lord Jesus Christ, which all men are responsible either for accepting or rejecting.

We teach all saved men and women that they ought to lay down their very lives for the salvation of others: that being followers of Christ means sacrificing all our own interests and enjoyments and possessions — our lives in fact — to save a rebel world, and that whoever does not so bear the Cross has no right to expect the Crown.

Our training of converts is, of course, based on this theory. The moment any man, woman, or child, kneeling at the front row in one of our barracks, professes to have received the remission of sins through faith in Christ, we require them to stand up and tell the audience what the Lord has done for them. This, in itself, is a test of the genuineness of the work; seeing that this first testimony, as well as the public surrender to God, made by coming forward to the front, is witnessed by old companions in sin, members of a man's household, or workmates.

The professed convert's name and address is registered, and where our plan of organization is perfectly worked he is at once placed under the care of a sergeant, whose duty it is to see that he comes up to all the services he is able to attend, or else to report him to the captain for visitation. The new convert is expected to put an "S" on each collar, or something of the kind, at once, and thus show his colours wherever he goes. It is of course explained to him at the penitent form, if he does not know it beforehand, that we require him to give up the use of intoxicating drink altogether, and he soon finds that we look upon tobacco and finery in dress as little less objectionable.

The converts are expected to take their place forthwith in every open-air meeting and procession, and on or near the platform in every meeting indoors, and to use every possible opportunity of service, in singing, speaking, prayer, door-keeping, selling of The War Cry, visiting — in short, to become soldiers. To all who so conduct themselves a soldier's pass or certificate is issued, renewable quarterly. Those who for three months conduct themselves in a satisfactory manner are to be passed from the general roll, on which all recruits are entered, on to the roll of efficients.

We have very little trouble in the way of discipline as ordinarily understood, for we compel all our soldiers to live under the blazing light of public service, and we find the bare-faced hypocrite to be a very rare creature. No ordinary working man or woman can maintain before workmates and neighbours for many hours such an open profession of religion as we demand, unless they really possess and enjoy it. On the contrary, one of our greatest difficulties is to find the fallen ones, who almost invariably avoid the very sight of an old comrade, even removing to a new home rather than encounter those who could remind them of their fall.

The wonderful newspaper accounts of persons, generally described as "captains," convicted of crime have all related, except in three cases of drunkenness, to people who were not connected with us at all, and the three cases referred to were those of reclaimed drunkards, who were never officers, but who, after having for some time shown themselves faithful as privates, relapsed for a time into their former sin.

Of course there are many instances in which the work that seemed to be done proves either to have been unreal or transitory; but the proportion of these to the total of professed converts cannot be large, or the progress of the Army would suffer frequent and severe checks, instead of presenting in all directions such rapid and ceaseless growth. Having to organize mostly by means of uneducated persons, we have a slow and uphill task in perfecting our local records and arrangements; but there is constant improvement, and we hope soon to be able to account definitely and fully for everyone who once comes beneath our influence.

Our plan of organization, moreover, makes every soldier in some degree an officer, charged with the responsibility of so many of his townsfolk, and expected to carry on the war against the streets, street, or part of a street allotted to his care. Around every corps, in like manner, will be mapped a portion of the country, and every village will be placed under the care of a sergeant until a corps be established in it under commissioned officers.

The country is divided into some thirteen divisions, each under the command of a Major, whose duty is not only to direct and inspect the operations of all the corps already established; but to see to the extension of the war to new localities, to the calling out of new officers, and to the removal of either officers or soldiers who have ceased to be fit for their position.

Each corps is under the command of a Captain, assisted by one or two Lieutenants, who are entirely employed in and supported by the Army, and whose duty is not only to do their best by conducting services outdoors and in, and by visitation of those already enlisted; but ceaselessly to plan and operate for the salvation of the whole population committed to their charge.

These captains and lieutenants are removed from one corps to another every six months or thereabouts, in order to avoid the danger of settlement into old ruts, or of a too strong attachment on the part of either the officer or soldier to person or place, rather than to God and the war.

The system of government is absolutely military. Those who ridicule our use of military terms would cease to do so if they had any idea how really we are an army. We have thousands if not tens of thousands of soldiers who are ready at a word to leave all and go out to rescue the souls of others, and who glory in submitting to the leadership of the men or women placed over them for the sake of Christ and the world.

Some, of course, who have informed themselves of the facts, condemn our absolute system of government as unscriptural and dangerous, if not worse than that. But we have tried other plans, and found them wanting. We began with the paternal pattern, but afterwards experimented freely in a system of extreme democracy in government. For years we laboured in the constitution of committees, large and small, after the models of the surrounding churches. But we found in all this no advantage, and endless difficulty and trouble. We have always found the most godly and devoted workers the least disposed for debate or mere talk, and that the great result of consultations, committees, and the like, is obstruction, vain-glory, and idleness. We find that real soldiers care little who leads, or how they march, so that there is victory, and that we get along best without the people who must needs discuss and vote about all they do. We have never enjoyed such unbroken peace and harmony everywhere as we have had since it has become thoroughly understood that the corps is under its Captain, the division under its Major, and the whole army under its General, with no hope for any one of successful agitation against superior authority.

The management of affairs has necessarily, with the growth of the Army, come to be divided, and the heads of departments at headquarters and the Majors in their several divisions have each to bear a large share of duties and responsibilities, in order that all the business may be speedily and carefully dealt with. It is also a very great object with us to avoid using our system of government so as to limit spiritual liberty or hamper with awkward restrictions any officer in the accomplishment of his great mission. To condemn, for instance, the devoted young man who, in his intense zeal for the good of others, issues a bill against which "people of taste" cry out instead of kindly helping him to do better, would be as ruinous and foolish as to shoot the young and spirited horse that has smashed your carriage against a gate-post.

The property of the Army is held for its exclusive use by the General for the time being, under the terms of a deed enrolled in Chancery on the 7th of August, 1875, and our solicitors, Messrs. Whittington, Son, & Barker, 3, Bishopsgate Street Without, E.C., hold in their possession our deeds and a complete schedule of all property thus standing in the General's name.

The finances of the Army. — We have always taught all who attended our services the duty and privilege of giving in support of the work, and the majority of our corps are now self-supporting.

Each corps has its treasurer and secretary, to whom, as well as to the Captain, everything connected with the local finances is well known. The officers receive no salary until all other local expenses, such as rent, gas, &c., are met. The books of the corps are examined from time to time by the Major and by officers from headquarters, who have, however, nothing further to do with the local finances. Each division has its fund for divisional extension, administered by a local treasurer and secretary under the direction of the Major.

The general funds of the Army, out of which the expenses of the staff, the salaries and expenses of the Majors, the first cost of opening new stations, the support and travelling expenses of cadets, and all the other multiplied costs of management are met, is sustained by subscriptions and donations from persons of all religious denominations, amounting last year in all to only some £21,000, and is accounted for under the constant supervision and annual audit of Messrs. Beddow & Sons, chartered accountants, of 2, Gresham Buildings, Basinghall Street, E.C.

The General has never received a penny out of the funds of the Army towards his support, which has always been provided for, in the good providence of God, otherwise.

The publications of the Army, including The War Cry and The Little Soldier, with a joint circulation of some 360,000 weekly, are not only a mighty power for the propagation of the Army's teaching, but will in time become a great source of income thereto.

The officers of the Army are drawn from the ranks. Those who prove the most valuable soldiers are recommended by their captains to headquarters, inspected and reported on by the Major, and if then able to answer, to the satisfaction of the General himself, a lengthy series of questions, they are invited to the Training Barracks at Clapton. Here a few weeks of East London work test their qualities and qualifications very severely, and meanwhile they are trained in conducting every branch of the service, carefully drilled, and taught the simplest way of conveying the great truths of the Bible to their people. The training given, however, does not purport to be so much scholastic as spiritual, the great necessity continually pressed upon every one's attention being that of holiness of heart and life. Those who prove to be unfit for an officer's post are unhesitatingly sent back to their place in the ranks.

The care exercised in selecting cadets, however, is such that this necessity does not often arise. Very few persons are received as officers who do not give up homes or positions more comfortable from a worldly point of view than the one they come to, so that the Army is pretty well secured against the ravages of self-seeking persons.

After from six weeks to three months' stay the cadet is suddenly dispatched as a lieutenant to some captain in the field. Neither captain nor lieutenant has often many shillings in his pocket when he lands in a strange town to commence his work. Constant dependence on God for all his needs is a lesson often learnt amidst very hard surroundings. But so rapid and complete is the success generally gained nowadays, that the officer's lot is not often one of great privation. Mob violence is becoming more and more unusual, as the Army is better known and understood by the authorities and the masses, and the officers are able to give their whole strength with little drawback to the service.

Each officer is expected to conduct from 19 to 25 meetings weekly, extending over 30 to 35 hours; to spend 18 hours in visiting from house to house, and to spare no possible effort besides for the good of souls. The utmost amount of salary to be drawn by a single man captain is 21s. weekly, by a woman captain 15s., and by a married captain 27s., with 1s. per week per child, so that the Army is never likely to be troubled with drones.

The work of an ordinary Sunday commences with a prayer meeting from 7 o'clock till 8. Then follow open-air meetings or marches from 10 to 11, from 2 to 3, and from 5.30 to 6.30, followed by indoor services from 11 to 12.15, 3 to 4.30, and 6.30 to 10. Upon extraordinary occasions the programme is varied by a march at 6 A.M., a mass meeting in the open air from 10 to 12.30, or a march after some of the indoor meetings.

The officer's position is, moreover, held simply, so to speak, by the sword, the unsuccessful man after sufficient trial being left without appointment. Moreover, as already pointed out, the officer who has for six months been winning the love of a corps and a town, is then removed, often at a very few days' notice, so that any little beginning of a selfish sentiment is checked, and the spirit of a united and single-eyed devotion maintained. An officer is, in short, expected to be an example of self-sacrifice for the salvation of the world.

What will it grow to? Who can guess? I cannot. Never, I hope, into a sect. We have taken and shall continue to take every precaution against this. Warned by the failure of John Wesley in maintaining his unsectarian position, we are striving to avoid what we think were his mistakes.

1. Instead of refusing to complete our organization, we strive to perfect it more and more, making it, however, step by step, more exacting on all who join, so as to exclude all but real soldiers, leaving to the churches all who wish mere church life.

2. Instead of insisting upon attendance at any church, even for the Sacrament, we teach our people to spend all their leisure time with the Army, to visit churches only as corps by invitation, so as to promote general godliness and harmony, and to avoid as the very poison of hell all controverted questions.

By these means we have certainly attained already a most friendly footing in relation to all the churches in many localities, and we trust, in another year or two, to have no only gained the warm sympathy of all godly men, but to have spread far and wide a spirit of love and hearty co-operation that will do much to lessen the dividing walls of sectarianism.

At any rate, whoever may smile or frown, "The Salvation Army is marching along." We are not only extending the work in this country at the utmost possible speed, but purpose, God willing, ere the year closes, to reinforce and expand our operations in France, America, and Australia, and to establish headquarters, at any rate, in New Zealand, India, Sweden, and Holland.

We are just commencing, too, the organization of separate corps for children in each town, with barracks and daily services of their own, which will, we have no doubt, give a very great impetus to the War. We hope that ere the end of the summer the appointment of sergeants to villages near our town corps will have greatly increased our numbers.

But, above all, we trust ever to increase in that entirety of devotion to the Lord Jesus, which, sweeping away, as it must, all consideration for ourselves and our own future, must needs ensure to us the greatest favour from Him who is our strength and our all, and the widest, the most unbounded usefulness to a ruined world.

This comprehensive statement from August 1882 represents William Booth's most complete explanation of The Salvation Army during its rapid expansion period. Writing seventeen years after his initial East London evangelistic efforts, Booth provides a detailed account of the Army's organizational structure, theological positions, training methods, financial operations, and future vision. The document reveals a fully developed military-style organization with 320 corps, 760 full-time officers, and 6,200 weekly services. Booth's emphasis on absolute military command structure, rigorous convert training, officer accountability, and international expansion demonstrates how his movement had evolved from local mission work into a disciplined global evangelical force. His explicit comparison to John Wesley and determination to avoid sectarianism shows Booth's strategic thinking about maintaining the Army's unique position as a supplement to, rather than replacement for, traditional churches.
