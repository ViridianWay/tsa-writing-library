# More about Women's Rights

_From "Short Articles & Practical Guidance" by William Booth_

---

November, 1901

MY DEAR COMRADES,

You will remember that I left off writing to you a few weeks ago in the middle of my subject. It has been whispered to me that some of my soldiers would rather that I wrote upon a fresh topic every week, and I daresay that it is so. But you see, the General cannot always say all that he feels it necessary to say on a subject, in one short letter, so those to whom his letters come must have patience with him and give him a chance to finish. They must also remember that he does not write these letters for his own pleasure, nor even for the pleasure of his soldiers, but for their profit, and what seems necessary to gain that end must be said, whether it is always quite agreeable or not.

Now when I closed that letter I was referring to some of the blessed results that have followed the labours of woman in The Salvation Army. She has succeeded again and again, as you know, where men have failed, and would have failed again. I met with a remarkable illustration of this, in a cutting from an Australian newspaper sent me by an officer over there. I will give you a copy of it and you can judge of it for yourselves:

> "A short time ago a Negro was executed in Australia. He had been an awful outlaw for many years, and had committed, they say, no less than 5,000 crimes. After his condemnation he rejected every attempt of the chaplain and other ministers to produce any impression on him. His heart only seemed to harden more and more. As a last effort, a woman officer of The Army was introduced to his cell, and after she had prayed with him, and talked and sung to him a little time, his stubborn soul gave way, and then he wept and prayed. He sought God, and went a humble penitent to the gallows."

When I read that story I said, "What a mercy it would have been for that man, and for those he had wronged, if a salvation girl could have reached him and spoken to his heart years before."

It is no wonder that I appreciate the value of woman's work. She has been my co-worker from my earliest salvation days. Some of the most effective helpers, in my youthful labours among the people of my native town, were women. I do not know how I should have stood my ground, and gained anything like the success I had, in those days, if it had not been for some young girls who earnestly, and modestly, and prayerfully helped me. I was not seventeen at the time, and had everything to learn; but they helped me through. All, or nearly all, those dear comrades are gone now into the next world, but I shall meet them again. And, as at the first, so all along my journey, Godly women have been my helpers in every work I have undertaken for God and man. That assistance I here acknowledge, and for it thank God with heartfelt gratitude and praise.

Whether, however, this great and useful agency shall still go forwards with energy and success, depends very much on woman herself.

It is true that in some corps there are to be found objectors to women occupying prominent positions as local officers, but those corps are, thank God, few and far between. There are here and there, however, as I hinted in my last, husbands and parents within our ranks, and a large number outside of them, who object to woman taking a prominent place in the fight for God, but these do not constitute a very great difficulty. The Salvationist woman herself has the matter in her own hands.

We have by God's blessing opened the door of opportunity for woman, and made the platform for the exercise of her gifts. It is now for the sisters themselves to claim their privilege, to enter the door, and to fill the position. Sisters, what do you say? Suffer a word of exhortation from your General:

1. **Seize every opportunity presented to you indoors and out of doors.** If one is not made for you, make one for yourself. I have done so all the way through life, and I have not known many women, or men either, so far as that goes, who were of much use in the world, who did not act on this rule. Why should not you? If you wait for someone to fix your task and to help you to begin, I am sorry to say that in some corps, and with some officers, you will wait a long time. Set yourselves on. God will be your master. God will see to your success.

2. **Testify and sing and talk as you have opportunity.** Don't be kept silent by notions as to your unworthiness or inability. If you have not as much capacity as you might possess, or your comrades think you ought to possess, give yourself plenty of practice. Remember that practice makes perfect.

Do not let your natural shyness or timidity hold you back. Break through. I have suffered from this feeling from the first day I stood up to say that my sins were forgiven. I am often hindered by it now. But I have made progress by dashing at my duty whether I have liked the doing of it or not. Do the same, my sister, do the same.

3. **Conform to the rules and conditions that will make you useful and acceptable to your comrades and to the people whom you want to benefit.** There is no denying the fact that some of our women soldiers are more acceptable in their work than others. That is not to be objected to. They have more ability in getting through eargate to the consciences and souls of the people. But each one of us must make the most of those gifts we do possess. Try to do your work acceptably, and whatever else you do when you stand up to either sing, or pray, or talk, do it from your heart, and hold your head up, and speak out loud enough to be heard without difficulty. You will improve every time.

In all you do, rely on God, and go straight for souls. That will put you right and keep you right.

4. **Teach such children as may be under your influence to understand and honour the position of women, and to respect their privileges in working for souls and everything else.** Specially do this with the boys. Train them to it. Begin at once. In this matter, be a pattern to them at home, in the Junior Company, and wherever else they may be under your influence. Thanks to the example set before their eyes, and the teaching they received from infancy, my boys, now that they have grown to be men, are firm believers in woman's true place and mission. I am quite sure that, no matter how strongly I might have wished this to be so, it would never have come to pass unless their dear mother had set before them the duty and pleasure of treating woman as the equal of man, and as deserving of their honor and consideration.

Now, my sister comrades, what will you do? You will not disappoint your General, so go down and ask God to forgive you where you have come short of your duty, and give yourselves afresh to the doing of it, and that with all your might.

**Historical Note:** This follow-up letter from November 1901 provides practical guidance for implementing women's equality within The Salvation Army. Booth's four-point action plan demonstrates his understanding that institutional change requires both policy and personal initiative. His emphasis on training boys to respect women's equality shows remarkable foresight about the need for cultural transformation across generations. The Australian newspaper story illustrates the practical effectiveness of female ministry in situations where male clergy had failed, providing concrete evidence for Booth's progressive stance. This letter reveals how The Salvation Army was actively working to change social attitudes about women's roles, not merely accepting them within their own organization.
