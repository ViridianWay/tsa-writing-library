# Do It with Thy Might

_From an Article by William Booth_

---

Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might. Do it, and do it at once. Your life is uncertain; your days are numbered, and at the longest, in view of what you have to do, they are very few; therefore take the work that God has by His spirit and providence made evident to be your work, and do it at once, with all the energy you possess of body and soul. Do IT WITH THY MIGHT.

We have a conviction that this might-work is the great want in the Christianity of the present day. Men take up religion with the tips of their fingers, as a matter of little or no importance; worthy of being considered and attended to, but only in its place—and that mainly on the Sabbath, and always in subordination to considerations of reputation and pleasure and gain. No wonder that such persons make no progress, and have no strength, and find no inward peace and gladness in the Saviour's cause. The great God, whose first claim is the heart, and who will go no further with any man, under any circumstances, until that claim is complied with, spurns such worshippers, and disowns such disciples. "The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force."

Dear brethren in a crucified and risen Savior, fellow-soldiers in the army of Immanuel, at the beginning of a new year, we urge upon you this exhortation, that whatever the Master requires, you should gird up the lions of your mind, and trusting in Him only for strength, go forth and do it with your might.

## I. Separate Yourselves from All Evil

You are called to a separate life from the worlding. "Come out from among them, and be ye separate." Renounce the pomps of the world and the works of the devil in reality. Put away from you all known sin, of whatever kind and whatever degree. Have no communion with the unfruitful works of darkness. Touch not the unclean thing; that is, whatever God by His Spirit or Word makes you to feel to be unclean, touch it not; and if on any questions you are uncertain, whether any course or thing be right or wrong, give your soul the benefit of the doubt, and have nothing to do with it until you can enter upon it with a good conscience, and with the full assurance of the Divine blessing. Oh, how sin will plead for life! How it will entreat to be spared! Oh, what plausible arguments Satan will bring to move you to pity, and at least postpone for a season the putting it away. And oh, how friends near and dear will join to entreat you not to be too severe on yourself, not to be legal, not to be a melancholy fanatic! But, like Pilgrim, you must put your fingers in your ears, and escape for your life. You must turn you from all your iniquities, lest they prove your ruin. How useless to complain of the lack of peace while you allow these Philistines to remain in the land—to mourn the absence of assurance of the Divine favour while you take pity on the Lord's enemies, and, when He has commanded you to slay every one of them, you allow them to live. If you would have a better year, let there be a faithful search for all these troublers of Israel, and bring them forth, even Agag the king, and slay them before the Lord. Rouse up your soul to this duty, and "do it with all your might."

## II. This Might-Work Is Also Required in the Work of Consecrations

The great sin of the race is setting up for itself, and the present perpetual duty of every man is to go back to the footstool of Jehovah's throne, and acknowledge His sovereignty, and lay self and substance at His feet, prepared then and for ever after to obey His every word and do His perfect will. But this will require might-work. This is no light matter. No half-hearted, hesitating, undecided souls will hold on to this, though they may attempt it. Look at Abraham, how he must have felt when God first gave him the command to offer up his son Isaac. What a trial it must have been to all the finest, strongest feelings of his nature, and what an effort the decision to obey must have required. Yet, though difficult, it was done; and we read that Abraham rose up early the next morning to comply. But it would not have been done had he conferred with flesh and blood. Had he consulted his friends, and waited and argued as thousands do, his heart would have failed him, as their hearts do; but he did it at once, because he did it with his might. He would never have started, he would never have gone the three days' journey, he would not have had strength to ascend Mount Moriah and roll the stones together for an altar, and pile the wood, and lay his darling boy thereon, and bind him with cords, and lift his arm to slay him, had he not have done it with his might.

And so, dear friends, in the consecration God requires from you, I see no hope of power, and peace, and victory, except you are prepared, like Abraham, to do it with your might. The half-hearted fail here, and fall out of the ranks by wholesale, their bones whiten the wilderness. Only the Calebs and Joshuas, who follow God wholly, go through the Jordan of difficulties, and take possession of the promised land. You must be thorough. We have any amount of half-and-half consecration—consecration which lacks the very element of honesty, which is not in reality before God, which is only in imagination, which does not extend to practical every-day life, which fears the Lord in church and chapel and mission-room, on Sabbaths and new moons and fast days, while hymns are sung, and prayers are offered, and exhortations are made, but which extends not to the stern work of everyday life—to money, and dress, and business, and conversation. But this is what God requires. This was the ground of His controversy with His people of old. They wanted an outside religion of form, and ceremony, and sentiment; He asked for a religion of real love and service; they refused to render it, and He cast them off. Brethren and sisters, His requirements are still the same; you must, you can, comply, but only by doing it with your might.

## III. Believe with Your Might All He Has Said in His Holy Word

Not only the world, but the professing church is full of infidelity. The stream of skepticism is flowing strongly against you, and you must set yourself to meet it with all your might.

Those religious sceptics say it requires an effort to believe that God suffered and went through the change which we call death; and so, admitting the Cross, they deny the divinity of Him who hung upon it. Or they say, they find it difficult to believe that God will send all those to hell who reject the salvation He bought for them on the tree. So they interpret hell to signify the grave, and damnation to mean annihilation. Again, others will say that, admitting that the wicked are cast into hell, they find it hard to believe that a loving God will keep them there forever; they say their hearts rebel against the doctrine; and so they have a scheme for the destruction of the worm that Jesus Christ said never dies, and for putting out the fire which He said never would be quenched. Now, we admit difficulties in the way of your faith on these and other topics. The Bible admits this when it enjoins you to fight the fight of faith. Without opposition there can be no conflict; but you must meet them by a determined holding on to the simple word. You may have a sharp contest now and then, but you will be sure to have an easy and a glorious victory, if you do it with your might.

But not only do we urge you to be a bold believer in the statements of the Book, but in its promises. Ask, What is there offered me? How far am I interested in the death and will of my Lord? What is there bequeathed me? And, having settled that by carefully inquiring, not what saith the creed, catechisms, or experience of the Church, but what saith the will itself. Then claim the legacy in all its fullness, height, depth, length, and breadth; and finding, as you will find, that your being saved to the uttermost, and filled with all the fullness of God, hangs on this condition of faith, set yourself to believe with your might.

Oh, this believing is the hinge on which your peace, power, and enjoyment of God turns. Oh, this is the door into the storehouse of the Divine fullness, before which so many sit down empty, and blind, and naked, mourning over their wretchedness and leanness, instead of pressing in and on to the realization of all the inward heaven bought by the love of Christ, and which the Father longs to bestow. But this faith requires might-work. The world, the flesh, and the devil are against it. At every step ten thousand difficulties will rise, every one of which will be sufficient to vanquish you, unless you are solemnly in earnest—unless you believe with your might; then you are more than conqueror.

> Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees  
> And looks to that alone,  
> Laughs at impossibilities,  
> And cries, "It shall be done."

## IV. Work for Jesus, and the Salvation of Souls with Your Might

The Church and the world don't want for effort merely; we have an immense amount of it. Look at this city—nay, look through this kingdom—what an amount of preaching, singing, praying, visiting, and tract-distributing there is! But, of this pile of labour, how little might-work there is in it all! And yet this is what we want. Not a lazy, mechanical, heartless, round of duty, just to get a living, or fill up time, or satisfy conscience; not to amuse yourself, or amuse other people, but, with life or death depending on your faithfulness, and energy, and promptness, we want you to do it with your might.

Around, on every hand, you may see men weary themselves out, filling asylums and crowding early graves with the wasting wear and tear of body and brain, by labours more abundant in the strife after money, and knowledge, and pleasure, and fame. And oh, shall we be sluggards and laggards? Shall we be half-hearted, neither hot nor cold, in the great and godlike enterprise of saving our fellowmen? Nay! God and angels, and heaven and hell, alike cry out to us, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might."

Brother, if you preach, do it with your might. Mind your aim—the glory of God and the salvation of those who hear you, and see that you adhere to it. Oh, how many begin in the spirit in this respect, and end in the flesh. They are like coals of living fire for a season, and then they grow weary; and earth, and hell, and cold-hearted Pharisees will try ten thousand arts to draw you from it; but you must cleave to it with your might.

Oh, strive to your uttermost to bring poor sinners to God at once. Show them the cross, and urge them to be saved; not at some other time, but there and then. Mind that the devil and the example of other poor, fallen, sleepy preachers do not lead you off into the ruinous notion of education the people preparatory to their being converted at some other time. The devil cares little or nothing for sinners being instructed, or forming good resolutions, or for what are sometimes called delightful influences and good feelings. He looks on, perfectly indifferent, until he finds the sinner on his knees crying, "Lord, save me now!" or boldly laying hold of the offers of grace, going at once through the gate of faith into the way of life.

O my brethren and sisters, who go forth in the name of the Master to invite sinners to repentance, whether in the open air, or mission-hall, or wherever it may be, be faithful to your Master, and he in earnest with the people. It is said that when a once-popular minister, who had won very great applause as a flowery, pleasing preacher, came to his death-bed, he was in great darkness and fear. A friend present reminded him, as ground for comfort, of the beautiful sermons he had preached. "Hush!" said the dying man, "I was fiddling while Rome was burning." Brethren, don't go planting thorns in your dying pillow after this fashion. Be faithful with your hearers; cry aloud, and spare not; show the people their transgressions; uncover the bottomless pit, on the crumbling edge of which they are standing, and then, by all that is solemn and sacred, implore them to fly at once to Jesus; and oh, be sure and do it with your might.

You must pray with your might. That does not mean saying your prayers, or sitting gazing about in church or chapel, with eyes wide open, while some one else says them for you; but it means fervent, effectual, untiring wrestling with God. It means that grappling with Omnipotence, that clinging to Him, following Him about, so to speak, day and night, as the widow did the unjust judge, with agonizing pleadings, and arguments, and entreaties, until the answer comes, and the end is gained. This kind of prayer be sure the devil, and the world, and your own indolent, unbelieving nature will oppose. They will pour water on this flame. They will ply you with suggestions and difficulties. They will ask you, how you can expect that the plans, and purposes, and feelings of God can be altered by your prayers. They will talk about impossibilities, and predict failures; but if you mean to succeed, you must shut your ears and eyes to all but what God has said, and hold Him to His own word; and you cannot do this in any sleepy mood; you cannot be a prevailing Israel, unless you wrestle as Jacob wrestled, regardless of time or aught else, save obtaining the blessing sought—that is, you must pray with your might.

Go about, pleading with men and women for their souls, but do it with your might. Visit them from house to house, but not for mere chitchat. Much house-to-house visitation, we fear, amounts to little more than gossip. Merely talking about the Gospel, and giving good advice, will not go far. A few kind words are useful to introduce you, and then introduce your Master, and sit down if you can, but only preparatory to kneeling down; and be sure and deal faithfully with every soul with whom God gives you opportunity. Visit the open shops on the Lord's day. Plead with the people who are on the way to hell, wherever you meet them, and do it with your might.

Oh, my brethren, what a blessing this might-work has brought with it in the past! What wonderful things are recorded of it!

Look at your great example. Look at Jesus: how true He was to His aim; how steady to His purpose, from His childhood to His grave; how with undivided heart, he went about His Father's business, undiverted by all the opposition of earth and hell. See Him where and when you will, whether working, praying, preaching, suffering, or dying. He did it with all His might.

Look at the long array of prophets, apostles, martyrs, and confessors who have gone before you, and "who" through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again; and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection; and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented (of whom the world was not worthy). They wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth." But they were conquerors; they overcame, through the blood of the Lamb, and by the power of the Holy Ghost, the world, the flesh, and the devil. This was the work God gave them to do, and they did it with their might.

And, oh, what a wonderful blessing this might-work would bring to the world now! God is as willing as ever to bless. The Bible says so. This is the condition. God is in earnest, and He wants those who are co-workers with Him to be the same. Wherever you find men or women now, who are truly in earnest, no matter where their sphere or what their capacity, there you find the windows of heaven opened, and blessings pouring down upon them. Brethren, read the promises again. Look at the wonderful engagements God makes to visit and bless those who seek Him and the advancement of His glory with the whole heart. Be in earnest! Be in earnest! BE IN EARNEST! Heed not the smiles or frowns of men. Read your Bible. Avoid sin as you would the fires of hell. Pray without ceasing. Look to God for strength for all duty. Seek constantly to bring souls to Christ. Aim at nothing less than holiness of thought, word, and life; and try every hour to bring honour and glory to the Lord God of your salvation, and DO IT WITH YOUR MIGHT.

This stirring New Year's exhortation from January 1870 captures William Booth at his most passionate, calling for wholehearted commitment to Christian discipleship. Written during his independent evangelistic ministry (five years before founding the Salvation Army), the article reveals the intense earnestness that would characterize all his later work. Booth's four main themes—separation from sin, complete consecration, unwavering faith, and zealous soul-winning—formed the spiritual foundation upon which the Salvation Army would be built. The article's emphasis on "might-work" versus half-hearted religion reflects his conviction that Christianity demands total commitment. The closing exhortation, with its triple call to "Be in earnest!" and final emphasis on "DO IT WITH YOUR MIGHT," exemplifies the urgent, militaristic spirit that would soon transform into the Army's distinctive approach to Christian mission.
