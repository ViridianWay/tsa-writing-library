# The Conversion of the World

_From an Article by William Booth_

---

The following Plan for the Conversion of the World, is affectionately and earnestly recommended for the adoption of every Christian reader of the Evangelist.

1. Let each converted person endeavour to bring one soul to God in the course of one year.

2. Let him fix upon two or three individuals whose conversion he shall specially seek; and if after much care and pains he appear likely to fail in those cases, let him fix upon others. Let the selection be made according to providential circumstances.

3. Let him enter upon this work in humble dependence upon the blessing of God for success; commit his cause to the Most High, firmly fix his mind upon the attainment of his purpose; and daily pray for the scriptural conversion of the objects of his spiritual solicitude.

4. Let him seek frequent intercourse with those person; put into their hands religious book; engage hem in religious conversation; bring them to hear the gospel, and to meetings held for public prayer; and labour to convince them that he is deeply concerned for their present and eternal welfare.

5. Let him pursue this object in the spirit of a generous catholicity, simply seeking the conversion of the soul, and resolving not to be satisfied without one such case every year of his life.

6. Let every new convert be instructed that it is his duty to engage in the same work; and that if he do not attempt to spread his religion, the probability is, that he will soon lose his confidence and his comfort.

Now, here is a Plan for the world's speedy conversion, comprising no complicated machinery, but marked with a simplicity adapted to every class of society, and every grade of intellect, and founded upon the acknowledged scriptural principle, that it is the duty of Christians to diffuse their religion, and labour for the conversion of sinners. Ought it not therefore to be tried? Let us try it for at least one year.

This concise article from October 1869 presents Booth's systematic approach to personal evangelism during his early ministry. Written while he was still an independent evangelist (before founding the Salvation Army), the piece reflects his conviction that world evangelization could be achieved through simple, practical methods available to every Christian. The six-point plan emphasizes personal responsibility, strategic focus, prayer, persistent effort, and the immediate involvement of new converts in evangelistic work. This multiplication principle—where each convert becomes an evangelist—would later become a cornerstone of Salvation Army methodology. The article demonstrates Booth's characteristic blend of ambitious vision ("the world's speedy conversion") with practical, actionable steps that ordinary believers could implement.
