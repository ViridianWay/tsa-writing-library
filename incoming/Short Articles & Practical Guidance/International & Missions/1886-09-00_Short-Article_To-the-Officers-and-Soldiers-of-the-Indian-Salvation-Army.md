# To the Officers and Soldiers of the Indian Salvation Army

_From "International & Missions" by William Booth_

---

September, 1886

MY DEAR COMRADES,

The recent visit of Commissioner Tucker and his brethren to this country, and the enquiries which that visit has stimulated, have greatly increased the interest and affection felt by myself and fellow workers in the vast populations of your country.

The first proof of this interest is to be found in the money that has been contributed, and far more so in the devoted band of officers selected from among the most intelligent and self-sacrificing that we possess, who, while I write this, are on their way to Ceylon; and if the immediate results accomplished are in any way equal to the promise and the interest already awakened, the sympathy felt and the help contributed will go on increasing in the future.

That it may be so I want to point out my own clear impressions as to the methods that should be followed in carrying on the Indian war.

First one thing is clear and incontrovertible, and that is that the mission of The Salvation Army in India is to its heathen populations. To raise and bless these is its work. For their miseries and sins we believe we have a remedy, and to reach them with it is our primary duty.

The other populations, that is the European, Eurasian, and "native Christian," may need us as much, perhaps more so, in as much as guilt is in proportion to the measure of light possessed; and there is no doubt that these classes enjoy much more light than the native peoples, and are therefore much more guilty before God and in danger of much deeper damnation. Still, in consideration of their vast numbers, and the long night of sorrow and tears under which they have groaned, the natives have by far the strongest claims upon our compassion. And to effect their deliverance and bring salvation to their ears and hearts The Army is directly sent. Go, my comrades, benefit the other classes, if possible, as you pass along, and form branch armies of European and semi-European corps on the model of this country, if you have opportunity. They will doubtless help you in supporting and carrying on native work. But do not undertake this if it will in any way hamper your main operations, for as emphatically and as positively as I can possibly put it I want to say your mission is to the heathen themselves.

Nothing must take you off from this. Plenty of people with European notions and projects will try to divert you by all manner of difficulties and statements, but you must not listen to them lest you be turned aside from your work. Do not try to kill two birds with one stone; if you do, you will assuredly miss both. Fix your eye, your heart, and your aim upon the native, and go for his salvation with all your might! Now, with respect to the natives, your work is plain, namely —

1. To attract their attention.
2. To gain their confidence.
3. To save their souls.
4. To train them up to live and fight for God and the salvation of their fellows.

How this is all to be done must form your life study. We have learned something, not very much perhaps in comparison with what there is to be learned, but still it is something which has helped us to win some glorious victories. We must not despise or throw this experience overboard, but rather act upon it until we learn more.

Beware also of expecting too great results at the onset. We fancy some labourers in the Indian battlefield have expected success with the outlay of even less labour than there has been found necessary to secure the same amount of success at home. If you want victory you will have to fight for it, no matter what part of the world you are battling in, and you must not expect results in India with less outlay of labour and anxiety than have been required to produce them in other lands.

Here I may remind you that perhaps in no other country will there be a louder call and a wider opportunity for the display of that principle of adaptation which is a fundamental principle with The Army everywhere. In order to conquer you must stoop, becoming with the Apostle Paul all things to all men in order that you may win them to your Master. This must mean, if anything at all, that to the Europeans you can be as Europeans, to the Eurasians as Eurasians, and to the natives as natives.

And yet in this adaptation there is to be no departure from the known and acknowledged principles of The Army. These fit all circumstances alike, and are adapted to the character of the humanity of every age and of every clime. These principles have succeeded wherever they have been faithfully tried, and persistently held on to. There can be no question that they will be found to apply to the millions of India as they have to the millions of the English speaking race.

1. **But more particularly let me again revert to the four divisions of your work as previously stated.** Let me begin with the first named, that which says our first business with the natives is to attract their attention. This important end will be found to you comparatively easy, and, wherever you appear, already accomplished. Your name alone brings you a crowd. They have been made to feel before you enter into a town that they must come to see and hear you. Your appearance, music and native uniform draw them to listen to your message, to enquire about your doings, and to wonder whether you may not be divinely sent to them. What an enormous advantage this gives you over every other form of Christian effort I need not describe. Oh, that you may prove worthy of your opportunity!

2. **The next part of your work demands that, having attracted the attention of the natives, you should proceed at once to gain their confidence.** A good beginning has also already been made here. You have a reputation with the natives of being their friends, which has to be sustained and perfected. This is your mission. How most successfully to accomplish it is to be your life work. Without their confidence you will utterly fail. They must believe that you really care for them, not for the sake of any religious or worldly gain, but from love for their souls and a desire for their welfare. All then will be easy, having made them believe in you, they will be literally compelled to believe in your message. How will you do this? The way has already been laid open plainly before you. Commissioner Tucker, Majors Jai Bhai, Eshwar Das, Bullard, and Weerasooriya, and other comrades have discovered a path which leads up to the native's heart, and, to some extent, have trod it themselves.

Imitate their example, travel over the same course. Go to the native as a brother, which indeed you are, and show the love which none can doubt you feel. Go to him, eat and drink, and dress and live by his side. Speak his language, share his sorrows, and make him feel that you have come down, if it is a coming down, to act after the fashion of that Christ whom you call Master and Lord, in order that you may raise him up out of his miseries and sins.

If I mistake not this will bring such success as missionary annals have never recorded before, and lead to a nation being born in a day.

3. **Then as to the third part of your mission, which is to save the heathen.** This will be accomplished with the Indian exactly as it is with the European, and that is just as it was with yourself. You remember how you were converted. When you gave up your sins and sought God and cast your soul on Jesus Christ, He took your sins away, received you into His favour, gave you the spirit of confidence, love, joy, hope, and you praised Him day and night. It will be just like this with the Hindoos, the Mohammedans the Cingalese, and every other kind of human being who has wandered away from God when they repent and return to His feet, that is if they are converted at all.

4. **And then there remains the fourth part of your duty, which is to train the souls so won to be saints, and make them soldiers to fight by your side.** And here let me say that your success can only be counted by what you keep. So many saved here, and so many at the penitent-form there, sounds very delightful, but it is the soldiers you possess twelve months afterwards that I note as the only indication of true advance. Moreover, it is not only what you have in numbers but in quality. The quality of true soldiers is always measured by their fighting power. Your business as a branch and portion of The Salvation Army is to make warriors, to secure what you win, and to use it to the best advantage.

How most effectually to accomplish this is henceforth to be your constant study. Here you have many advantages. To begin with, you are not bound by any stereotyped or antiquated notions. What is being done in Europe or America, or what has been done in India in the past, or what is being done in the present need not be any rule to you unless you can see it is calculated to gain the end you have in view. Indeed, in methods for India, you are not so much imitators as inventors, for verily, verily, the results of the past efforts of missionaries are not such as to lead you to very highly value the modes by which they have been brought about.

Go, my comrades, and pray and look about you, and so acquaint yourselves with native modes of thought and feeling and action, and then adapt yourselves to them so far as such adaptation shall be consistent with the doctrine of the Bible and principles of The Army.

You will succeed! It will cost something to win India. Nay, to follow up, increase, and establish the success already attained, will require some considerable sacrifice. But this once done I feel confident that such a wave of conquest will follow as the world has never before seen in connection with salvation.

But this, I repeat, will cost something. It cost something to win you and me and the handful of soldiers Jesus Christ has in Europe. Rivers of Blood have been shed to gain this result, and somebody must be willing to suffer for India, and I do thank God that I believe somebody is forthcoming.

Therefore, my comrades, you must not be surprised when tribulation appears, and yet I would have you greatly encouraged. So far as I can read the signs of the times, I believe marvellous victories are before you - the men and women of this generation in the expedition which has just left our shores.

Only be prudent and faithful and true to God, your officers, your principles, and the mighty advances of The Salvation Army shall not only be repeated in India, but altogether passed and eclipsed! Farewell, my comrades. Take all reasonable care of yourselves, and in dark and cloudy days remember that the sympathy and prayers and confidence of your General and of tens of thousands of comrades are with you; that tidings of your welfare will be looked for by every mail, that we will weep with you and rejoice with you here, and triumph with you when we meet you "in the everlasting morning."

**Historical Note:** This September 1886 letter represents William Booth's strategic guidance to The Salvation Army's pioneering mission in India, written just as the movement was expanding beyond its British origins. The letter reveals Booth's revolutionary approach to cross-cultural missions, emphasizing adaptation while maintaining core principles. His four-point strategy (attract attention, gain confidence, save souls, train soldiers) and his directive to "be as natives to the natives" established a template for culturally sensitive evangelism that was decades ahead of conventional missionary practices. The letter also demonstrates Booth's understanding of the challenges and sacrifices required for effective cross-cultural ministry, while expressing confidence in ultimate success through divine guidance and cultural adaptation.
