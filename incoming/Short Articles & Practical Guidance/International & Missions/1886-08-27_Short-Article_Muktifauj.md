## Introduction, and Letter from the Founder

### Introduction

The Salvation Army in India has followed a path differing from that of other workers in this vast Mission Field. There has been no desire whatever in doing so to reflect on the plans, or policies, pursued by others; but we have believed that our own path was the most direct, and that in choosing it we were guided by God. Certainly there was no idea that our path would be an easier one.

Looking back now on a period of forty-one years, we are able to realize that we have indeed been following the Pillar of Fire by night and of Cloud by day. Not one promise has failed of fulfillment. If we had to go over the ground again there is little in principle that we should propose to alter, and we think that we may humbly claim that the seal of God's approval has rested upon our labors.

True we have made some mistakes which a richer experience has enabled us to rectify. We have also spent some time in reconnoitring some highways and byways which proved to be fruitless and unprofitable.

But we think that apart altogether from the bunches of grapes of Eshcol, and other fruits of this goodly land, which we are able to present to our readers in these pages, we can claim to have given a general impetus to Missionary Work in India, and to have helped to bridge the gulf which divides India from Christ, for other feet besides our own.

When we landed in Bombay a leading Christian paper had recently stated that some of their readers had asked them to give an account of existing revival work in India. The Editor mourned that he could not report what, so far as he was aware, did not then exist. There was an atmosphere of depression resting upon the Indian Mission field.

From the day the Salvation Army landed in Bombay that complaint has never required to be repeated. Not only did our own work speak of rapid advances, but, catching the same forward spirit, many of the workers around us were able to tell of a surprising and extensive movement among large and increasing numbers of the population, till the now familiar term "Mass Movements" was finally coined to describe the position. The latest Census of India shows that during the last decade the increase has averaged no less than 87,787 per annum, or a total of 877,876 for the period between this and the previous decennial Census of 1911. To God be all the glory!

In the providence of God we have ourselves been able during the last forty years to launch out among new lines, and in doing so have learned many valuable lessons, which would not otherwise have been possible. Living for years as an Indian, and following at times, with other comrades, the extremest lines of sacrifice, such as begging my food from door to door, and sleeping in the huts of the poor, or under trees, I have had opportunities for observing India such as few have possessed. Our devoted Officers have also supplied me with much valuable information gathered from similar sources. We have got to know the Indian in his own home — not in the more or less artificial life of the city — but away in the villages where 90 per cent of the population live and toil. We have thus almost unconsciously come to "think Indian." God has helped us to open, and enter, the door to her inmost heart.

I need only add that the entire plan of campaign had whole-hearted approval of our beloved Founder, who followed every movement with the keenest interest. "Get into their skins" was the epigrammatic summary of his instructions to his representatives in India. It was heartily endorsed by his then Chief of the Staff, our present General, W. Bramwell Booth. Nor was the problem studied merely at a distance, and at long range, but visits were paid to India, both by the Founder and his Successor, particulars of which will be found in these pages.

The wise and far-seeing character of the instructions received by us will perhaps best be judged by the following letter received from the Founder, after the work had been in progress for about four years.

### Letter from the Founder

INTERNATIONAL HEADQUARTERS,  
QUEEN VICTORIA STREET,  
LONDON,  
27TH AUGUST, 1886.

MY DEAR COMRADES,

The recent visit of Commissioner Tucker and his brethren to this country, and the enquiries which that visit has stimulated, have greatly increased the interest and affection felt by myself and fellow-workers in the vast populations of your country.

The first proof of this interest is to be found in the money that has been contributed, and far more so in the devoted band of Officers, selected from among the most intelligent and self-sacrificing that we possess, who, while I write this, are on their way to Ceylon; and if the immediate results accomplished are in any way equal to the promise and the interest already awakened, the sympathy felt, and the help contributed, will go on increasing in the future.

That is may be so I want to point out my own clear impressions as to the methods that should be followed in carrying on the Indian War.

First, one thing is clear and incontrovertible, and that is, that the Mission of The Salvation Army in India is to its non-Christian populations. To raise and bless these is its work. For their miseries and sins we believe we have a remedy, and to reach them with it is our primary duty.

The other populations, that is the European, Eurasian and Native Christian, may need us as much, perhaps more so, inasmuch as guilt is in proportion to the measure of light possessed, and there is no doubt that these classes enjoy much more light than the non-Christians, and are therefore much more guilty before God, and in danger of much deeper damnation. Still, in consideration of their vast numbers, and the long night of sorrow and tears under which they have groaned, the non-Christians have by far the strongest claims upon our compassion. And to effect their deliverance, and bring Salvation to their ears and hearts, The Army is directly sent. Go, my comrades! Benefit the other classes, if possible, as you pass along, and form Branch Armies of European and semi-European Corps on the model of this country, if you have the opportunity. They will doubtless help you in supporting and carrying on native work. But do not undertake this, if it will in any way hamper your main operations, for, as emphatically and as positively as I can possibly put it, I want to say, your mission is to the non-Christians.

Nothing must take you off from this. Plenty of people with European notions and projects will try to divert you by all manner of difficulties and statements; but you must not listen to them, lest you be turned aside from your work. Do not try to kill two birds with one stone: if you do, you will assuredly miss both. Fix your eye, your heart and your aim upon the Indian, and go for his Salvation with all your might!

Now, with respect to the Indians, your work is plain, namely —

1. To attract their attention
2. To gain their confidence.
3. To save their souls.
4. To train them up to live and fight for God and the Salvation of their fellows.

How this is all to be done must form your life study. We have learned something, not very much, perhaps, in comparison with what there is to be learned, but still it is something which has helped us to win some glorious victories. We must act upon it until we learn more.

Beware also of expecting too great results at the onset. We fancy some labourers in the Indian battlefield have expected success with the outlay of even less labour than has been found necessary to secure the same amount of success at home. If you want victory you will have to fight for it, no matter what part of the world you are battling in, and you must not expect results in India with less outlay of labour and anxiety than have been required to produce them in other lands.

Here I may remind you, that perhaps in no other country will there be a louder call, and a wider opportunity, for the display of that principle of adaptation which is a fundamental principle with The Army everywhere. In order to conquer you must stoop, becoming with the Apostle all things to all men, in order that you may win them to your Master. This must mean, if anything at all, that to the Indians you must be Indians.

And yet in this adaptation there is to be no departure from the known and acknowledged principles of The Army. These alike fit all circumstances, and are adapted to the character of the humanity of every age and of every clime. These principles have succeeded wherever they have been faithfully tried, and persistently held on to. There can be no question that they will be found to apply to the millions of India, as they have to the millions of the English-speaking races.

1. **More particularly, let me again revert to the four divisions of your work as previously stated.** Let me begin with the first-named, that is, that which says our first business with the Indians is to attract their attention. This important end will be found by you to be comparatively easy, and wherever you appear, already accomplished. Your name alone brings you a crowd. The people have been made to feel, before you enter a town, that they must come to see and hear you. Your appearance, your music and your Indian uniform draw them to listen to your message, to enquire about your doings, and to wonder whether you may not be divinely sent to them. What an enormous advantage this gives you over every other form of Christian effort, I need not describe. Oh, that you may prove worthy of your opportunity!

2. **The next part of your work demands that, having attracted the attention of the Indians, you should proceed at once to gain their confidence.** A good beginning has already been made here. You have a reputation with the Indians of being their friends, which has to be sustained and perfected. This is your mission. How most successfully to accomplish it is to be your life work. Without their confidence you will utterly fail. They must believe that you really care for them, not for the sake of any religious or worldly gain, but because you love their souls and truly desire their welfare. All then will be easy; having made them believe in you, they will be literally compelled to believe in your message. How will you do this? The way has already been laid openly plainly before you. Commissioner Tucker, Majors Bullard and Weerasooriya, and other comrades have discovered a path, which leads up to the Indian's heart, and have trodden it themselves.

Imitate their example, travel over the same course. Go to the Indian as a brother, which indeed you are, and show the love which none can doubt you fell. Go to him, eat and drink and dress and live by his side. Speak his language, share his sorrows, and make him feel that you have come down, if it is a coming down, to act after the fashion of that Christ, Whom you call Master and Lord, in order that you may raise him up out of his miseries and sins. If I mistake not this will bring such success as missionary annals have never recorded before, and will yet lead to a nation being born in a day.

3. **Then as to the third part of your mission, which is to save the Indian.** This will be accomplished with the Indian exactly as it is with the European, and that is just as it was with yourselves. You remember how you were converted. When you gave up your sins, and sought God, and cast your soul on Jesus Christ, He took your sins away, received you into His favour, gave you the spirit of confidence, love, joy, and hope, — you praised Him day and night. It will be just like this with the Hindus, the Mahommedans, the Singhalese, the depressed classes and every other kind of human being who has wandered away from God, when they repent and return to His feet, that is, if they are converted at all.

4. **And then there remains the fourth part of your duty, which is to train the souls so won to be saints, and to make them Soldiers to fight by your side.** And here let me say that your success can only be counted by what you keep. So many saved here, and so many at the penitent-form there, sounds very delightful, but it is the Soldiers you possess twelve months afterwards that I note as the true indication of advance. Moreover, it is not only what you have in numbers, but in quality, as the quality of true Soldiers is always measured by their fighting power. Your business as a branch and portion of The Salvation Army is to make warriors, to secure those you win, and to use them to the best advantage in winning others.

How most effectually to accomplish this is henceforth to be your constant study. Here you have many advantages. To begin with:

You are not bound by any stereotyped or antiquated notions. What is being done in Europe or America, or what has been done in India in the past, or what is being done in the present, need not be any rule to you, unless you can see it is calculated to gain the end you have in view.

Go, my comrades, and pray and look about you, and thus acquaint yourselves with Indian modes of thought and feeling and action, and then adapt yourselves to them, so far as such adaptation shall be consistent with the doctrines of the Bible and the principles of The Army.

You will succeed! It will cost something to win India. Nay, to follow up, increase, and establish the success already attained, will require some considerable sacrifice. But this once done, I feel confident that such a wave of conquest will follow as the world has never before seen in connection with Salvation.

But this, I repeat, will cost something. It cost something to win you and me and the handful of Soldiers Jesus Christ has in Europe. Rivers of blood have been shed to gain this result, and somebody must be willing to suffer for India, and, I thank God, that I believe many will be forthcoming.

Only be prudent, and faithful to God, and to the principles of The Salvation Army, and our mighty advances in Europe, America, and Australia shall not only be repeated in India, but altogether surpassed and eclipsed! Farewell, my Comrades! Take all reasonable care of yourselves, and in dark and cloudy days remember that the sympathy and prayers and confidence of your General, and of tens of thousands of Comrades, are with you; that tidings of your welfare will be looked for by every mail, and that we will weep with you here, and triumph with you and rejoice with you there, when we meet you "in the everlasting morning."

Believe me,  
Your affectionate General,  
William Booth

**Historical Note:** "Muktifauj" (meaning "Army of Liberation" in Hindi/Urdu) represents The Salvation Army's revolutionary approach to missionary work in India. F. Booth Tucker's introduction and William Booth's 1886 letter reveal the Army's pioneering strategy of cultural adaptation—"get into their skins"—which stood in stark contrast to the European colonial missionary approaches of the era. This document captures the foundational philosophy that led to remarkable success in Indian missions, emphasizing the need to "think Indian" while maintaining core Christian principles. The Founder's four-point strategy (attract attention, gain confidence, save souls, train soldiers) became a template for cross-cultural evangelism that was decades ahead of its time in recognizing the importance of cultural sensitivity and indigenous leadership in missionary work.
