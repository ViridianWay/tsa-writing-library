# The Foundation of Hope - Christ The Supreme One
**General Lyndon Buckingham**  
*Colossians 1:15-23*  
*Salvation Army Bible Conference, August 4, 2025*

---

Dear Heavenly Father. I would want that my first words in this House this morning would be an honor and praise of you. I recognize you as the creator of the universe, the one who holds it all together. I acknowledge your power and your authority. I recognize that you are holy, that you are wise, that you are just, that you are fair. I celebrate you in the presence of my brothers and sisters, because you have chosen to reveal yourself to us as a God who is gracious and loving and kind and merciful and forgiving. And I give you praise and thanks this morning for my own experience of your love, grace, and mercy in my own life, made available to me in the person of Jesus Christ, your Son, the Savior of the world. 

I acknowledge you, father. You are here. You are amongst us. You are here to bless us. You're here to speak to us. You're here to guide us. You're here to wrap us in your love. Amen. All glory to you, God. You are worthy of our worship. You are worthy of our praise. You are worthy of our adoration, our affection, our love, our devotion. We worship you, God of creation. Minister, your grace to us. We pray in the beautiful name of Jesus, our Lord and Savior. Amen. 

And having acknowledged his presence, I feel now comfortable enough to acknowledge yours. My brothers and sisters in the faith, good morning to you. I greet you in the powerful name of Jesus Christ. And I say grace and peace to each of you. 

Let me say to you that we're very excited to be here. Bronnie and I, we have so much emotion going on right now. We're delighted to be with brothers and sisters in the faith. We're excited to be at Bible Camp. We're excited to be at Lake Junaluska. We have never been here before. This is new territory for us. So this is all good already. The emotions are high. 

We've been put in beautiful accommodation. We have every snack that is available to have in this beautiful part of the world. There is no way we're going to carve our way through all that you have provided. But we're going to try really hard to maximize your graciousness to us. 

Uh, we are also thrilled because our family is here. Our son and daughter in law and two grandsons. Our daughter and son in law and granddaughter. They're all here. We haven't been together for over a year, and so you can imagine that just loving on them has been such a blessing to us since we have arrived in this place. You are witness to us kind of reconnecting with our clan. Uh, it's fun to watch. It's deeply emotional. 

In fact, I had some moments. I hope you'll forgive me, but I had some moments where I thought to myself, right now I'm sensing what God, our heavenly father, feels about us, right? Uh, when I put my arms around my son and I put my arms around my daughter and my grandchildren. Oh, my goodness, I was thinking, yeah, this is this is how Heavenly Father wants to wrap himself around us. Oh. It's beautiful. Uh, so I'm giving thanks to God for the blessings that have already been bestowed on us. 

Jennifer. You lit up the house this morning. Come on, all glory to God. Uh, that was that was something else. I almost got saved. No, I'm just kidding. We thank God for his anointing on your life and your faithfulness to the word and the way you passionately presented the word to us this morning. Beautiful. And we give glory to the King for that. 

So we're delighted to have the opportunity to be in your presence. There's some things you need to know right up front about, um, me, you've already guessed. I have a very strange accent, and I'm just praying that the Lord will help you to be able to understand, uh, what this Kiwi, who hasn't lived in New Zealand since twenty thirteen and has lived in other parts of the world, has really messed up the way I talk. Uh, but I'm praying that you will be able to kind of overcome that. 

Second thing you need to know is this, uh, there's a person down the back called Emma who is, I think, going to attempt to drive a PowerPoint presentation. The first thing you should know is I'm hopeless at creating PowerPoints first thing. So they're very basic. Second thing is, uh, they never fit what I'm actually saying. Uh, and so I have seen PowerPoint people down the back looking at the script, looking at their PowerPoints and listening to me and going, not one of those three things is adding up. So they're not quite sure. 

So, Emma, you are free from all responsibility wherever you are. What happens is what happens. And if none come up, it's perfectly okay. It won't bother me because I'm going to go off track with them anyway. 

Uh, last thing I think I need to confess to you, uh, before we launch into what I've had laid on my heart to share this morning, um, is that I live in this blurry space between teach and preach. Do you know what I mean? Like, uh, you're you're asked to teach something from the scriptures, but you slide into preach. There's a gray area between the teacher and the preacher, and I have to just be honest. I've discovered that I live in that gray space. I'm somewhere in there. And that's just what happens. Uh, and so sometimes I get caught in something. And what I think is going to be a teach turns into a preach. Uh, that's just the way it is. Now I'm getting too old to be able to change that, so I'm just embracing it, and I'm asking you to embrace it with me. Uh, that there will be moments where teach turns into preach and preach turns into teach. And maybe you yourselves will not be able to fully understand what space I'm actually in. But it's all good. It's all for the glory of the King. 

## The Book of Colossians

Uh, when given our assignments, Bronwyn and I felt led by the spirit to focus in on, uh, the the kind of the beginnings of the early church, those foundational, uh, gatherings and communities of faith that were learning what it meant to practice what it meant to be a child of God through faith in Jesus Christ. Right. And so we felt led to the book of Colossians. Paul's letter to the Colossians is full of beautiful, beautiful teaching about the Christian's hope. And so, uh, the sessions that we will share are focused in on Paul's letter to the Colossians. 

Uh, it is felt that Paul was probably writing this letter whilst a prisoner, and even that is worth exploring that this guy in prison. Still singing, still praising, still believing, still glorifying God, still teaching, still writing letters, still telling people and encouraging people about the person of Jesus Christ and the great hope that is theirs because of him. So we're focusing in on this letter. 

He's writing to a group of believers in Colossae who are surrounded by all sorts of different kinds of religions and expressions of faith. He is concerned because in the group of believers there is starting to be false teaching, false doctrine, some confusion, some wanting to add things to the gospel, some people wanting to add to the person of Jesus Christ. He was very concerned that they should understand that the foundation of a Christian's hope is the person of Jesus Christ. That foundational to our faith is the person of Jesus. 

It's interesting to me that in the letter, he didn't attempt to refute any of the false teaching or any of the stuff that was circulating at the time. He didn't go into it point by point by saying, well, they're wrong here or they're wrong there, or they've got it mixed up there or they've gone off track here. He did not do that. He just went straight in with pointing out why it is that we should have confident hope in the person of Jesus Christ, who in his own letter he says is supreme over all. Jesus Christ supreme over all. 

So I have no problem this morning, spending the next few moments rehearsing in your ears that which you already know to be true. Everything we need is wrapped up in the person of Jesus Christ. 

It was a beautiful passage of Scripture that was read to us by Tia. I got that right. Are you okay, Tia? I'm great. Look. It's Tia. She's got to sit here now in front of you all for the next forty five minutes or so. I'm great. Just relax. Relax. Okay. I'm pleased about that. I was kind of feeling a bit for you guys, just, you know, now I've drawn attention to you. It's making it even worse. I probably should have just. I probably should have just left you alone. 

## The Supremacy of Christ

Tia read to us beautifully from the book of Colossians. She read from verse fifteen of Colossians. Uh, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by him all things were created. Things in heaven and on earth, visible or invisible thrones, powers, rulers or authorities. All things were created by him and all things were created for him. This is what Paul is saying about the Lord Jesus Christ. 

It's beautiful, but I want you, just for a few moments, to jump up a few verses in that first chapter because I want to read this to you, because this becomes a testimony that I can share through personal experience. He says in the first verses, we always thank God, the father of our Lord Jesus Christ when we pray for you, because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints, the faith and love that spring up from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven, and that you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel that has come to you. 

Then he says this all over the world, Old. This gospel is bearing fruit and growing. Hallelujah. I don't know how you did it, Jennifer, but I just got nothing then. I need to have a session with you. I'm going to say it one more time. All over the world, the gospel is growing and bearing fruit. It didn't take you very long. 

Um, I want to just testify to you as, uh, in our current roles, Bronwyn and I have had the privilege over the last couple of years of visiting many parts of the world, uh, under the umbrella of the Salvation Army. And we can bring you testimony that as true as that statement was when Paul wrote it to the Colossians, it is true today all over the world. The gospel is bearing fruit and is growing. 

Now, it's not reported in the newspapers. We don't read about it on social media. It's not BBC's frontline topic. But the truth is, the transformational power of the gospel is having impact on the planet. Men and women and young people are coming to faith. There is a beautiful renewal and revival movement sweeping across young people in Europe right now by their hundreds. They are looking back to the church for hope, for meaning, for purpose, for life. 

All over the world, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing. All we need to be encouraged by that, because the world would have us believe that the opposite is true. The world would have us believe that God is dead. They just don't understand that God is the God of resurrection. God is the God of reconciliation. He is the God of redemption. He is the God of renewal. He conquers the grave. He's not dead. He's alive and all over the world, not just in some parts all over the world. The gospel is bearing fruit and growing. 

It was our privilege to visit a country where the Salvation Army is growing faster than anywhere else in the world. And it's a muslim country, ninety percent Muslim. And yet the Salvation Army is growing there faster than anywhere else in the Salvation Army world. Lives are being transformed. Men and women are coming to faith and praise be to the Lord. Generations of young people throwing in their lot with the Lord Jesus Christ and the Salvation Army. Candidates. Waiting lists of more than two hundred. As people are waiting to be able to respond to God's calling on their life. 

Don't believe it when people say it's not happening. We're in decline. The church has had it. The church is over. This is not true. The gospel is bearing fruit and it's growing. Paul says to them in the same way that it's growing within you. Oh, we need to pause there just for a little bit, and do some reflection about our own personal lives, about the life of our corps, about where our Salvation Army is. We need to be able to say the same thing. Yes, it might be growing there, but it's also growing here. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, let it be so. Let it be so. We pray. Father, let it be so. 

## Personal Testimony

So Paul writes his letter to this group of believers, and he wants them to understand that they have done absolutely the right thing by putting their confidence in the person of Jesus Christ. He wants them to understand the supremacy of Christ, that if you have him, if you follow him, if you've surrendered to him, you have made the very best decision that you could ever make in your life. 

For me, it was the twelfth of August nineteen seventy nine, before some of you were born. Well, not all of you, I can tell because. Nineteen seventy nine. Some of you have been around for a while, I can tell. Nineteen seventy nine at a youth event as a young seventeen year old with no other motivation for being at the event than that I might meet a lady. The only motivation that I went to that event, that I might meet a lady. 

And in the middle of that meeting, as the speaker was speaking. God broke into my heart with a revelation of his love for me. For me, this troubled teenager, his love for me, revealed intimately and personally and passionately in the person of Jesus Christ, flooded my heart. I was full of joy, full of repentance. I was laughing, I was crying, I was overcome with the emotion of a powerful encounter of the living God, revealing to me the depth of his love, concern and interest in me in the person of his own dear son Jesus, who became a sacrifice, that I might be reconciled, that I might be forgiven, that I might be redeemed, that I might be renewed, that I might be a citizen of heaven, embraced by the love of God. It was a beautiful experience. 

So powerful was it in my own life that I reached out, grabbed a yellow candidates form, filled it in and said, I will be an officer in the Salvation Army. I tore it in half, kept half for myself, which I have in my Bible, gave the other half to the DUI. I had not even been called at that moment, but so overwhelmed by the experience, I could think of nothing better than to entrust myself into the care, into the keeping, into the leadership, into the direction of this God who reveals himself to me most intimately in the person of His Son, Jesus Christ. 

When Paul is writing to the believers in Colossae, he's saying, guys, I want you to understand. I want you to understand that in all things he is sufficient. He is enough. He is enough. He is sufficient. All you need you can find in him. 

## Christ as Creator and Sustainer

He really rips into it. In this passage of scripture, there are some commentators who believe that this may, in fact, have been a song of the early church, that it may have been sung to help people, to remember all of the things that are true about God's Son and our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. 

It says that he is the firstborn of all creation. That everything that has been created was created by him. He is the revelation of God's creative intelligence, all that has been made, made by him, Paul says. He was there at the beginning and he formed it. He's not trying to explain how he did it. He's just explaining who did it. He's not explaining the how. He is explaining the who. He is giving credit for the creation of the world to the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Scientists are working very hard to work out the how. We don't mind the fact that they are trying to work out the how. I'm fascinated by what scientists are discovering, what scientists are exploring, the new things they're discovering about the cosmos. I am terrible at science. I have no clue about science. I was banned by the teachers at my school from the science room. It seemed to be that in the science room. The only thing I managed to do was set fires. I seem to be able to make things burn even when we were dissecting a frog. Somehow I managed to turn that into a fire, so I was banned. 

So I have very little understanding and very little knowledge, and I appreciate and value those who are exploring the intricacies of the creation of the world, of the planet, of the animal life, of all of the stuff that makes up both this world and the cosmos itself. It is fascinating. The more they discover, the more I want to give praise to my King. Right. I don't know how God, but I know who. And I give you credit for the who. 

So the God in whom we have entrusted ourselves. The Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we have placed our faith, our confidence, our hope, and our trust, is credited with the creation of the universe. Paul says he is also holding everything together as the scientists try to discover how is this cosmos being held together. Paul is saying, I don't know how, but I know who. He's holding it all together. 

Let's think about that and put it into the context of our needs, of our struggles, of our reality, of our concerns, of the stuff that we're facing. Who is it that we've put our confidence in? Who is it that we've put our trust in? Who are we depending on? We're depending upon relying on and placing confidence in the one who's holding the universe together. No no, no. Come on. Really? 

When you place your faith and your trust and you surrender the leadership of your life into the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ. You are placing your trust, your confidence, and the leadership of your life into the one who holds the universe together, knows the beginning from the end, knows your circumstance, knows your need, knows his plan for you, will see you through. He holds it all together. We give him praise. We give him glory. We acknowledge him this morning. He is both the creator and he is the one who holds it all together. Glory be to you, Lord Jesus. In him all things are held together. 

## Christ as Head of the Church

Then Paul says an amazing thing to me. He says he is also the head of the body, the church. He is in charge of the church. The Lord Jesus Christ, the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, the ascended Lord Jesus Christ, who by the way, is coming again. He is the head of the church right now. 

Listen, uh, I have this opportunity as your current leader, as the current world leader, whatever that means. Take it seriously. Hold it lightly. It's going to be over in a flash. I'll go back to some little tiny town in New Zealand, and people will say, who was that guy? Can't even remember his name. He was a short, bald fellow who talked funny. I want to say this to you, but I want you to get it in your hearts because Jennifer referred to it in her session. The Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the Salvation Army. Ah, he's the head of the Salvation Army. 

If he's the head of the body, if he's the head of the body, the church. And we are part of the church. The Lord Jesus Christ is in charge of the Salvation Army. Now that comes to me both as a beautiful reassurance, but it also comes to me this morning as a tremendous challenge, because I fear that sometimes in the Salvation Army we are guilty of acknowledging his presence only. He's kind of present. We say his name. There might be the occasional reference to him. In some places, we might be able to say that the Lord Jesus Christ is prominent in that. There are symbols that point to him. He's in conversations. We speak about him. We talk about him as a great teacher and whose way is good. He's kind of prominent. 

But the truth is, the Salvation Army's future is completely dependent upon our decision to make him not just present, not just prominent, but to make him pre-eminent. That in all things, he is in the center of our movement. I have spoken before about missional drift, and I loved the testimony singing on the mountain yesterday. When I think it was the Corps Sergeant major who said, there will be no mission drift here, there will be no mission drift here. 

It worries me as I travel the world where I see evidences within our own movement, where Jesus has been pushed to the side. He's taking a back seat. He's referenced, but he's not in the center. And we have a responsibility in this generation and in this day to make sure that wherever the Of the Salvation Army flag flies wherever the shield is present on the door, that everybody is fully aware that the captain we respond to, the one that we march after, the one who we have put our trust, our confidence, and our hope is the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. He's in the center. He is in the center. He must be in the center or this movement has no purpose. He has to be in the center. 

Now I want to say to you, my brothers and sisters, that in the same way that is true for the movement that needs to be true for Lyndon Buckingham and Kelly Iglehart. Right? It has to be true for us. He has to be central here within us. He has to be the leader. He has to be the captain. He has to be the one to whom we bow the knee. 

## The Resurrection and Thomas

I love that story. Um, post the resurrection. I've gone off script. I've gone a little bit off script. Forgive me. I love the story post resurrection. It's recorded for us in John, sort of nineteen and twenty, where the Lord appears to the disciples, peace be with you. Here is hope now, man. These guys were despondent. They were fearful. They were anxious. They were concerned about their future. Uh, the crucifixion had taken place. He was buried. He was in the tomb. But now here he is breaking in on them. He invites them to touch him. Right. To see the reality. Uh. It's true. 

This is the greatest vindication that we have of God's plan and purpose in the person of Jesus Christ. The actual. Physical. real resurrection. It changes everything. The reality of his resurrection changes the whole game. It changes the whole scope of the universe. This is God speaking into the world through His Son. He lives. Touch me. 

The Bible says Thomas was not with them, Thomas was not with them. And they went to Thomas and they said, Thomas, we have seen the Lord, we've seen the Lord, and he's going, what? No. Come on. No no no no no no no. I saw what happened to him. I saw what happened to him. I know we've seen the Lord. Thomas says, well, unless I can touch. Right? Unless I can touch, I just don't think I can get there. 

I love Thomas. Thomas is a testimony to us. Thomas is our friend. Thomas is our eyes and our ears. Thomas is our hands. Because the Bible says that they were all together and they make a point in the scriptures of saying, and this time Thomas was with them. That's why you never want to miss one of these sessions, right? I'm telling you, don't miss any of the sessions. The session you miss is the one where you know God's going to turn up in power, and you're going to be sitting around the dining room table and they're going to say, oh, man, you should have been at the last session. It really kicked off. Oh, man. That's the one I chose not to go to. You need to be present this time. 

Thomas was present and the king comes amongst them. And you know his very first words. No condemnation, no judgment, no criticism. No. Where were you? Why weren't you here? None of that. The first thing he does is he presents himself to Thomas. Here. You're Thomas right now. Okay, go with it. Just go with it. He presents himself to Thomas and he says to Thomas, touch. Touch me. Put your hand here. See the. See the scars in my hands. Stop your doubting and believe. Oh. Beautiful. Powerful moment. 

Not present. Present. Now in the room with the king. But now in these moments. Something beautiful happens. Something holy happens. Something sacred happens. Because in those moments, Thomas bows the knee. And he makes this declaration whilst looking up into the face of the Savior of the world, the creator of the cosmos, the one who holds it all together. The one who burst himself out of the grave. Huh? Standing in his presence. Not with condemnation, not with judgment, but with love, with grace, with mercy, with purpose, with purpose. And Thomas responds, in those moments, my Lord and my God, my Lord and my God. 

Thomas went on to serve the master with all his heart, with all his passion, and with all his energy. My Lord and my God. 

## Present, Prominent, or Preeminent

You know, it's possible for many of us to be only able to define our relationship as one where he is present. We know the stories we're familiar with are what we've heard. We know people who know the master. We have a basic understanding of the scriptures and the story. He's kind of present, but there's been no bowing of the knee. 

There are other people, I'd call them cultural Salvationists, where the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is prominent. You may even be fronting up on a Sunday going to church. You might even be flicking through the scriptures and reading. You might be sitting beside people who are giving him praise and worship and adoration. But you've never bowed the knee, right? You've never bowed the knee, so you don't fully understand the hope that's held out for you in the gospel. You don't know the liberation of being set free, of being reconciled, of being redeemed, of being rescued, of being brought into the family of God. You've never bowed the knee. 

Preeminence is when you recognize that he is supreme over all things, including including your heart, mind, and will. And I want to tell you this morning that the most liberated people within this room, in this house today are those men and women and young people who have bowed the knee like Thomas and have surrendered heart, mind and will into the care and to the leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ. Because he's worthy. He's worthy. He's worthy. 

It's fascinating to me that in the person of Jesus Christ, both his teaching about his Heavenly Father, his teaching about the Kingdom of God, his actions, his death, and his resurrection all speak to God's love for us. All of it speaks to his desperate love, his desperate desire that we would be reconciled to him, that we would be embraced by him, that we would know freedom, that we would know liberty, that we would know joy, that we would experience hope, hope that holds in the midst of trial, hope that holds in the midst of difficulty, hope that holds even when things don't go the way we want them to go. Hope that enables us to let go of bitterness, to say no to jealousy and envy. To say no to temptation. Because the hope we have in him consumes our heart, our mind, and our will. 

I want you to reflect on that this morning. Present. Prominent. Preeminent. 

The Lord said the psalmist in Psalm twenty three, the Lord is my shepherd. He leads me. He leads me. A lot of people leading themselves these days getting into all sorts of trouble. Many people following leaders that are going to disappoint, that are going to let them down, that are not going to be truth tellers, right, that lead them down paths that lead to death. Who's leading you? 

Paul is saying to these beautiful believers in Colossi, say, listen, friends, you don't need Jesus. Plus plus plus, right? You don't need orders and regulations. You don't need mysticism. You don't need this stuff. Everything you need, both for this life and for the next life, has been made available to you in the person of Jesus Christ. He is supreme. 

## Our Living Hope

Our hope. Our hope is a living hope. It's a living hope in the person of Jesus Christ, his death, his resurrection, his ascension, and his promises. Where I am, there you shall be also. I am coming again to take you to be where I am. These are the promises of the grave breaking Son of God, creator of the universe, intelligence that holds the cosmos together, who reveals himself to you as one who loves you, one who cares for you, one who dies for you, one who lives for you, who promises cleansing, redemption, forgiveness. Fullness of life. Eternity. Hope. Hope. 

Or Paul kicks off his letter, desperately concerned that they and we would come to an understanding of the fullness of the person of Jesus Christ, Savior and Liberator. And so as we continue this series, as we continue to explore what it means to be in the presence of the King, what it means to awaken Hope. I want to say to you that for me, foundational to the awakening of hope in your life will be what it is that you decide, not what you have decided, but what you're deciding in these moments is true for you so far as the Lord Jesus Christ is concerned. Present, prominent or preeminent, victory, hope, and future lies. For those who say in my life he has central place. He's preeminent. I'm trusting him. I'm listening to him. I'm following him. I'm allowing him control of my heart, my mind and my will. This he gives me hope. 

Has my time gone? I have no idea. I think it has right. I think my time has gone. I think I'm over. Um, I saw Jennifer. She was. She was. You were looking up and you were finding a clock somewhere. All I see is five and seven, and I'm just. I think that just means I've got five or seven minutes left. But there's a there's clearly a clock somewhere. I have no idea where I am with the clock. I've got four more pages of material. That's terrible. Right. I've got four more pages of material, and that's just session one I've got. That's. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. I don't care, I don't care because I feel like I've come to a point where you and I just need to go, wait a minute, what is the Lord saying to me in these moments? I think I think we need just to pause right here. 

## The Challenge for Our Movement

I'm challenged by this for our movement. The supremacy of Christ. The King of kings. The Lord of lords. The creator's plan for our redemption. He has to be on our lips. He has to be on our lips. We have to speak about him. We have to talk about him. We have to get brave and say, well, we're not just going to do it by our actions. The cup of water in his name. Well, at least say his name. Say his name, say his name, say his name. He's the creator of the universe. He's the Savior of the world. He is hope. And sometimes we can't even say his name in this outfit of ours that we love. And that belongs to him because he is the founder and the head. We have to find our voice, people, the world that you and I are living in, the world that we're making our way through. as we head to glory. It's hopeless. 

And we are the agents of hope. We are. We are salt and we are light. And we are the aroma of Christ. We have to say his name. We have to give him credit. We have to give him glory. We have to be intentional about looking for opportunities to lift him up, to point to him, to tell his story. We don't have to convince anyone. Just tell the story. Let your life be the story. By putting him right in the center of who you are. Jesus, be the center right. Foundation of our hope. That dynamic that sets us apart on the planet is that we have put our trust in the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. 

## Closing Prayer and Invitation

Let's pray together. We've had a feast this morning from the Lord. I want to give you just a few moments because we have time. Just a few moments. We reflect on what our servant Jennifer shared. This morning. We think about Paul, who from prison is desperate that believers would understand. He's enough. He's enough. I promised the Lord that I would always give opportunity for people to bow their knee, to do the Thomas thing in the presence of the King, my Lord and my God. 

The foundation for your hope is what you determine about the Lord Jesus Christ. And the father stands ready, as I did with my kids and my grandkids when they arrived yesterday. The father stands ready with his arms wide, wide open, coming, saying, come on, kids, come on down. Come and meet me. Come and kneel in my presence. Say my Lord and my God. Let me embrace you with my love. Right. Let me declare to you that you are doing the very best thing, putting your confidence in the centrality of the person of Jesus. God bless you guys. God bless you. 

So in these moments while the music's playing, while we're praying, while we're reflecting, if it's in your heart, you want to stand in the presence of the King and you want to declare my Lord and my God, my hope is in the Lord Jesus Christ. You stand and declare it where you are. If you want to come and kneel and pray down the front, we have time. It's okay. It's not about us. It's about the king. You want to kneel in his presence and say, my Lord and my God. My hope is in you. Here's the place to do it. Come right now. Even as we're reflecting. God bless you guys. 

Here it is. Just beautiful moments in the house of the Lord to acknowledge that which has been shared to us in our sessions this morning, and to say to the King, yes, Lord, yes, Lord, yes, Lord. My Lord and my God. He rescues. Excuse. He redeems, he restores. He gives victory. He empowers. He sets free. He guides, he protects, he provides. He makes a way. It's who he is. If we celebrate it this morning, we celebrate it this morning. We say thank you, father. We say thank you, father. Be king. Be Lord, be Lord of my life. Be Lord in the movement. Let your name be lifted high. Let the good news of the gospel go out from the Salvation Army all around the world. Jesus saves. Jesus saves. Jesus saves. Be still. For the presence of the Lord is moving in this place. He comes to cleanse and to heal and to minister his grace. Glory, glory, glory be to the King of Kings. God bless you. God bless you. 

Father, we thank you this morning. Thank you for your words to us. Thank you for the revelation of your kingship and your lordship. We trust you. We believe you. We hope in you. You are enough. You are enough. You are enough. Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, you are enough. Father. God, I want to thank you this morning for the privilege of being in your house with my brothers and sisters. What a blessing. I thank you for everyone that's in this house today. For those that are seeking you one way or another. We thank you, Lord, that we have heard from you today. As we continue to fellowship together, let us be an encouragement to each other. Let us listen intently to the food that you have for us while we are here. And let us, each, by your grace, determine that as for us, the King who reigns supreme in our lives is the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, Savior of the world, King of Kings. Holder of the cosmos. In you we place our trust. In Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
