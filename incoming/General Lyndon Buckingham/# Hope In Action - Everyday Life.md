## The Halftime Speech

I was talking with the Lord this morning about this final opportunity that I have to share with you, in the context of our Bible camp and the image that came to my mind, uh, was, uh, the changing room at half time. Have any of you been in those spaces? You know, you've been on the field for the first half, and you're coming in to take the break before you hit the field again. Now, the truth is that for the coach, that speech that's given at half time can go either way. It kind of depends on how the team has been performing, right? It kind of depends on whether you are in front ahead in the game in our context. 

Of course, we're talking about rugby union, the greatest game on the planet. God's favorite game. Rugby union. I mean, it is a game where you are either fully in or you are in big trouble because it's a take no prisoners kind of game. And the half time speech in the cloak room, when you're getting ready to go back out, can go one or two ways. The team is sitting there and they're looking battered, worn, sweaty, puffing, uh, red faced. And either they are incredibly frustrated and despondent because it's not going so well, right? Or alternatively, these guys are pumped up because they're in front and they can sense that if they keep going, if they keep doing the business, if they stay on course, if they leave nothing on the field, then they're going to get themselves a victory. 

And so I was thinking to the Lord this morning, okay, I see the picture. I've got my head around the imagery. I kind of like it. It's my opportunity to say, okay, team, it's half time. Uh, we had the halftime speech in the first session. Oh, bless your heart, sister. Come on. Just repeat that. Uh, we had it. So let's just for a moment, imagine that. That was the pre-game speech, right? Uh, now it's halftime, and it's. What's next? It's halftime. It's halftime. time and we are winning. It's beautiful. We want to celebrate that we're winning and we're getting ready. Uh, it seems to me anyway, using this metaphor a little bit, that we're getting ready now to head back out because it is coming to an end. Right? We're getting ready to sort of re-engage. And so I'm giving you just a little bit of a re-engagement talk, right. It's the coach speaking to the team. Right. 

And so, uh, because it's my natural inclination to be a bit of an encourager, I think I'm sort of leaning towards, you know, just giving you the kind of pep talk. Come on, team, let's go. I feel like I want to say that to the Salvation Army. It's like, come on, team, we are not done yet. Uh, the master has not finished with us yet. The master has things for us to be and to do on the planet in his name for the salvation of people, right? He has things for us to do. So I feel like the talks got to be so far, so good, but so far so good. But if we were analyzing the last one hundred and sixty years, we might have to be honest enough to say we got off to a roaring start. Uh, and we're not done yet. But, boy, those last twenty minutes of that first half. You know, it's got a bit. You guys, you know, you lost your focus. You lost your concentration. Uh, you allowed the other side to get a few wins. You let down your guard. Your defense wasn't as good as it should be. Your attack wasn't as sharp as it could be. 

So, listen, if we're going to take the next half, if we're going to push out and be even more effective in the days ahead. Maybe we do have to have one of those pep talks that doesn't just say, oh, good on you. Keep up the good work, but says, come on, team, we got work to do. We got work to do. Uh, the master is calling on us in these days to not be asleep at the wheel. Hello? Yeah. He's asking us not to be asleep at the world. We've had people who love the Salvation Army and have had the opportunity and the privilege to speak for the Lord into the Salvation Army in these days, who have kind of challenged us. I've heard statements like Salvation Army, you have everything that we need. Whoa! Amen. Amen. Uh, but, but but, Lord. But, Lord. But, Lord. 

Now it could be said that perhaps I'm one person in the room. That kind of has a bit of an oversight of the state of play across the globe so far as the Army is concerned. Right. And there is absolutely no doubt that at this half time point, I would want to celebrate a lot of good things that are going on under the hand of God. I want to celebrate what's being achieved in his name, but I want to also testify to you to a holy dissatisfaction. Because when I see the resource of people, when I see the resource of wealth, when I see the name that opens so many doors, I said to myself, wait a minute. I think in the master's hands there could be much more for us than we're currently realizing that we're currently seeing that we're currently achieving in his name. 

I feel like the master is saying to us, team, be be brave, be honest. Be open, Be willing to adjust, to adapt, to alter course, to try new stuff, to create, to innovate. We need to be brave enough to recognize that that which has helped us to be successful in the past may not be appropriate to our future. Are we willing? Are we willing team to be courageous enough to put ourselves in the master's hands and say, Lord, fit us for the next half? On the return, Lord, we're asking you to fit us for the next half.

## What We've Learned This Week

I mean, everything that we need to set us up for the next half has been shared with us over these days. My goodness me, we have been reminded while we have been here of the awesomeness of our God. If you are here and you are in any doubt whatsoever about what God is like, you have not been paying attention because we have had it in spades while we've been here from all of the speakers. The greatness, the majesty, the power, the intelligence, the brilliance, the beauty, the love of the God of the universe who's holding all things together and has chosen because he loves us to make himself intimately known to us in the person of His Son, Jesus Christ. We are worshiping the God, the only God, the one who's worthy of our praise and adoration. We've been reminded that we're on the winning side because our God is God. Oh my goodness. And he's revealed himself to us in the person of Jesus Christ. 

We've been reminded while we've been here of the supremacy of Christ over all other things, both in this world and the in the cosmos itself. He is supreme over all things. The head of the church, the captain of this team. The owner of the Salvation Army. Owner, coach and player. He's it all. We've got it all in the person of Jesus Christ. It's been shared with us while we've been here. 

That God, who expresses his love for us in the person of Jesus Christ, acknowledges our sinful nature, our brokenness, our depravity, and plans brilliantly to break in and compensate for that, to redeem it, to reconcile it, to restore it, to put life back in it, and to do so in and through his own son, whose death and resurrection vindicates that everything he said about the father is true and trustworthy. Everything he said about himself is true and trustworthy. Everything he said about the kingdom is true and trustworthy, and everything he said about us is true and trustworthy. We cannot do it on our own, but we can do it with him. We're celebrating this as we get ready for the second half. We know that we're worshiping the God of the universe. He's on our side. He loves us. He knows us by our name, and he has revealed himself to us in the person of Jesus Christ, who has become our Savior, our Redeemer, our rescuer, and our Lord. 

We've reminded ourselves while we've been here, that not only is he these things to us, but that actually, out of his great love and mercy, he has declared to us that it's the desire of his heart to dwell in us. This this beautiful mystery of Christ in you. I I worry. I worry that we have not meditated and reflected on the significance of that truth that God, the creator of the universe, chooses to dwell in the hearts and minds of his people. 

I had the privilege of visiting Saint Paul's Cathedral. It's beautiful. It's just down from my office. If I do this, I can see it. And all the thousands of people walking by. Now that's a treat. I sometimes say to the Lord, you're very cool, because look at all these people, man. There's so many designs, so many shapes and sizes and ways of being. It's a big distraction. You know, it's supposed to be reading policy documents. And I'm watching people walking by this. This cathedral has been built to the glory of God, right? It's magnificent. And it tells the story of of the greatness and the grandeur and the majesty of God. When I visited over in a little corner, a tiny little corner, a little kind of chapel was set up. And Holman Hunt's picture of Christ standing at the door, uh, was was there. And I sat in that chapel for a little while, just reflected. And I felt the Lord say to me in those moments, here's the truth. I want you to understand London. That's what he calls me. Uh, I want you to understand the truth. London, as beautiful as this building is. My preference is to dwell in you. I mean, what? Have you seen me? Somebody did a cartoon. I don't know where it is. I don't know whether it can come up on the screen or not. Somebody made a cartoon of me, you know, and they sent it to me. I looked like Popeye. I was kind of. They've kind of done it on purpose. I'm sort of like this. That's kind of a pose. So really. God, that's the. That's the thing. You want to dwell in me. 

Why am I telling you? I'm just reminding you because you're about to go back, right? We're going back to play the second half. I want you to understand the majesty of God, right. That condescends to us in Jesus and says, and I want to make my home in you. This planet needs to be populated with men and women and young people who are carrying the very presence of the Redeemer, the very presence of God the Creator, the very presence of the reconciler, the one who brings hope, the one who brings life, the one who brings redemption. We carry him in us wherever we go. When you go back onto the field, remind yourself the King of Kings goes with you. He's in you. Not just for your benefit, as we've been reminded, but that you might walk him into the very spaces where you occupy. Right? 

We've learned while we've been here. As we prepare for the second half, we've come to understand that the God that comes within us to dwell comes with transformation in mind. He's cleaning house, huh? He doesn't want to be a silent partner. He doesn't want to be an appendage. He doesn't want to be the one that you run to like mum and dad when everything goes wrong. I mean, you can do that, but that's not what he's there for. He's there to reign. He's there to rule. He's there to guide. He's there to equip. He's there to sustain. He's there to bring wisdom. He's there to direct you in all your ways so that you will be impactful and effective for him, for the Kingdom. This is the work of the King in us. When we're getting ready to go back to whatever it is that God is calling us to. Understand when you go into the second half that you go back occupied by indwelling Holy Spirit, who is the King of Kings? Oh my goodness. If that doesn't change you and your approach to whatever it is you're embracing, whatever it is that you're facing, whatever it is that is your responsibility, just dwell with it for a little while. Let it sit. Let it melt into you.

## Our Responsibility to the Body

We've been reminded while we've been here. We've been reminded while we've been here that we also have a responsibility to the body of believers. We were reminded that we don't live our faith in isolation. We don't do it on our own. We do it in community. We call them our local corps or center, right. These are the places where we gather, um, we we need to talk about our corps. You know, it's been, uh, you've talked about not wanting to step on toes, and you kind of, you know, you were careful sometimes. Not so careful. It was good. It was good for us. It was good for us. Right? It was good for us. But let's talk about these fellowships. Team. Second half, second half. 

We have a beautiful understanding of the creator of the universe and his love for us in the person of Jesus Christ. We have a beautiful understanding of the work that he's done in our lives the reconciliation, the renewal, the life. We even have an understanding that he comes to lead, to reign, to rule. We've got that. That's beautiful. We have this understanding that when the Holy Spirit starts to produce in us the fruit that brings honor and glory to his name, that it's not for our benefit, it's for the benefit of others. We understand that the gathering of the community, the bringing of the believers together is important. The Scripture tells us, don't give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing. But all the more in these days when we get ready for the second half. The gathering for us is not only important, it's essential. 

Those places where we gather that's supposed to vibrate, that's supposed to pulse, that's supposed to smell of the presence of the King of kings, those places people are supposed to walk into those places and go, oh, what's going on here? What's this all about? Right. Am I talking about your place? These places are where we actually practice our faith. Now, I like that word. You know, you study to become a doctor, and then you get to practice medicine. I don't know how you feel about that. You have to really understand that word, right? Because I'm going to a doctor who's practicing on me. He's practicing his craft. You go to the dentist, and the dentist has a dentist practice. Sometimes they even put it on the front door. They declare right up front. You're coming in to see me. I just want you to know I'm in practice. It's like I will come back when you are in perfection. Right. When the sign on your door says, I've done a few, I know what I'm doing. Everything will be all right. That's when I'll step in. 

But we get the concept. Practicing our faith. What does that mean? That means that you're supposed to put that which you know to be true, that which you know is God's requirement of you as his redeemed child and a citizen of Heaven. Bronwyn spoke at about it the other day, that clothing of grace and forgiveness and love and kindness and mercy are all of those things. We're actually supposed to practice that stuff. 

I want to tell you that what makes people want to come to your corps is not the music. It's not even the preacher Corps officers. I mean, no disrespect. I mean, it's there. We're there for education. We're there to be equipped. Right? But the truth is that what will set your corps on fire is when those that are coming to the corps are actually practicing their faith. Now, it worries me, it worries me, it worries me. Because I think we've got corps around our army world where you're not so sure that the practicing of the faith is a priority. The practice of our traditions might be a priority. The practice of our form might be a priority, but what's going to set us on fire in the second half is that the practice of our faith becomes the priority. 

So we're loving each other. We're being gracious to one another. We are forgiving one another. We are encouraging one another. We are pointing one another to the master. We are speaking Jesus to each other. We are taking time to kneel in the presence of the King and pray with each other. We are worshiping him together. We are opening His Word together. We are being prepared together in that place of worship. Why am I coming to this place, to this house, to this community? Because I find that here I'm being fed and prepared and made ready for the second half. I wouldn't want to miss it. This is the place where I get the juice to do the journey. 

Now listen, if your corps is not like that, maybe you're the problem. I don't know. I don't know. Because here's the thing. Because I'm an encourager. You know, we all have our we all have our place, right? Um, because I'm the courage I have to flip, I can I can stay in that space just for a few seconds. You could be the problem. And that does require some reflection, right? Because I tell you, man, when you turn up to a community and. And you've got a face like you've been in a boxing match for sixteen rounds, right? Or a temperament or a manner about you, huh? You're having an influence before you even open your mouth, huh? You could be the problem. But here's the beautiful thing. I think you could also be the solution. You could be the solution. Don't underestimate this. You could be the solution. You're going back for the second half. You go back into your corps as a solution. I love that.

## Becoming an Influencer

I had a young person come up to me at the recent youth forum. They said they came up to me and they said to me, general, that's because they didn't know my name. And I said, hi, I'm Linden. And they said, oh, okay. Linden. Linden. I just want you to know that I am an influencer. Okay. I'd like to take your photo and put it on my TikTok. I don't know, something some thing. Right. And I said, okay, I'm down for that. I used the word down. You know, that's a sixty three year old man trying to be cool, right? I don't know the words. I'm down for that. That's all right. Yeah. She proceeded to take three photographs of me. She looked at all of them and said, no, that's not no. Don't worry. Off she went. What? I'm an influencer, but I'm not allowing you to be on my page. That will not be good for my page. So she took off. 

But as she went away, I thought to myself, wow, that is a great word. I love that word. That word has been captured by a generation influencer. Influencer? I'm going to put it on my CV. London. Buckingham. Influencer. I mean, why not, right? Here's the thing. I think you can all put it on your right. You can. Let's get name cards. Let's get name cards here. Right. Kelly Iglehart influencer. I mean, come on. When you introduce yourself to somebody, what do you want to say? Yeah. I'm captain Kelly Iglehart. Or do you want to say hi? I'm Kelly Iglehart. Influencer. I want that one. 

But listen, team, as we go back into the second half, let's not underestimate this. You have an influencer role. You can change the atmosphere of a room by who you carry and how you let that get lived out in your life. It's interesting, isn't it? Because when Paul was writing his letter to the Colossians, he said, you have to understand that one of our strategies, one of our missional strategies for revealing and pointing to the coming King and the kingdom that will happen. One of the pointers to that is our community. It's the way we live together. It's the way we treat each other. It's the way we welcome people. It's the way we encourage each other, the way we forgive each other, the way we love on each other, the way we pay the price, the way we pay the price to build the other up. This is what it means to be a part of the Body of Christ. 

And if your corps is not representative of that in the second half, we have to pray it in. For where two or three are gathered in his name, he can bring about revival. If it seems dead, he has the power to bring it alive. I've seen it, I've witnessed it, I've watched it. I've seen places that were slated for closure. And somebody has felt it in their heart to say, hey, you know what? Just give me a bit of time. We feel a calling of God to make ourselves available to this space. And suddenly, over a period of time, that which was slated for closure is the most buzzing place in the territory. Can it happen in your place? Absolutely. And you can be an influence one way or another. 

But in these days, as we get ready for the second half, Salvation Army. Please hear me. I'm saying this in love. We have to give attention. We have to give attention. We have to be incredibly intentional about seeking the Lord for fresh winds of fire through our gathered communities of faith. We have to ask the Lord for courage. We have to ask the Lord for creativity. We have to ask the Lord to help us to innovate, and to be a community of faith that pulsates with the love of God in such a way that the place itself becomes attractive. People hear about it in the community. You go there, they pray with you. They love on you, they welcome you. They reveal Jesus to you. They are really intentional. They're not going there for selfish reasons. They're going there to honor God, to prepare themselves to be the people of God. That's what they get there for. That place is a humming place to be. And I can testify that it's a humming place to be. Do you know why? Because I go there, and I'm an influencer. I have committed myself to that space. And man, do I influence. 

We're getting ready for the second half, team. Go back to those places. Go back to those places. Wrap your arms around your corps leaders and say, let's agree together that we're going to support each other to make this place. Now, I'm not saying your place isn't. And if your place is. Yay, you. You're already winning the second half. Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up. But if you know, like I know that we've got places where that ain't the truth. We can spin it around and we need to. We need to. Because as we were reminded in our review before our second half. You guys weren't here. Most of the really great blessings happened before you arrived. But God is gracious. So we got some morsels for you, so hang around. He'll catch up. Oh that's funny. 

If we're going to be effective in this second half, and if we want the movement and its activities to be pulsating with people of God, these communities of faith become really important to us because they're the cooking pot. It's where we grow disciples, right? It's where we nurture future officers and future leaders. It's the cooking pot for where we nurture future Missionaries and evangelists and teachers, right? It's the cooking pot for that stuff. Our corps places, our places of gathered worship. These are critical to the future health and well-being and effectiveness for the King of this part of the Body of Christ, known as the Salvation Army. I'm stressing this because I feel the Lord has laid it on my heart that we need, as a family together to be in prayer, seeking the Lord for how we can make our gathered communities even more effective in his hands. For extending his Kingdom and preparing our people for mission. Will you join me in the prayer? Will you join me in the prayer? We're going to pray together around the world that God, the Holy Spirit, is going to do something beautiful, something new, something vibrant within our gathered communities of faith, uh, to prepare us for the second half. Agree with the Lord even this morning that you will be an influencer in that space, in that space, in the gathered space. 

This is the stuff we've been talking about. It's fantastic, isn't it? Oh my word. That's why that group looks so holy out there. I'm telling you, they've listened to more sermon and more teaching in the last week than some Salvationists get in a whole year. What a shame. But that's why they look so sanctified. If you guys look closely, you'll see there's a glow off them as they're ready, man. They are ready for the second half. It's fantastic.

## Jesus' Model for Ministry

One of the things I love about, uh, looking into the scriptures is you get insights into the Lord Jesus Christ is a beautiful passage of Scripture towards the end of Matthew's gospel around the end of the ninth chapter. And he talks about it, talks about the writer, talks about Jesus, and he says that Jesus was going from village to village, and he was meeting in the synagogues, and he was teaching there about the kingdom of God, about the nature of the kingdom. He was revealing something of himself in those spaces in that gathered community. Right. He was preparing hearts. But it goes on to say. And then he moved out from village to village, and along the way he was setting people free. He was healing people. He was meeting people up the tree. People were reaching out to touch his garment. 

Why am I stressing this? I just want you to understand that we got a word while we were here that we are supposed to be sent. So as well as the dwelling, as well as the coming together for worship, for preparation, for discipleship, for instruction, for encouragement that we might practice our faith. Something of the practice of our faith is also in the sending out. And one of the things that I love about the history and even the current reality of our movement, is that we have captured these concepts within our framework and in our way of operating. We recognize the value not only of the gathering, but the deep importance of the sending, of the being out of the being in the street, of being in the world, not of it, but in it, uh, to bring about the things of God to be available to be his agents, to be his voice, to be his hands, to be his feet, to be those who are looking for any opportunity to give him credit, to give him praise, to lift him up, to introduce somebody to him, ready in our hearts on point, clearly understanding our missional mandate as a people who belong to God. 

Salvation Army we are a people who belong to God. He has mission and ministry for us beyond our walls. He wants us to be out and about. He wants us to be in the highways and the byways, but he wants us to take that which we have learned, that which we have understood, that which we have grown in that which we have practiced in our gathered community. He wants us to take it out and practice it in the world. We are always on influence. He's not an appendage. Sunday is not something we do for selfish reasons. We don't gather there just to take care of our business. We recognize the commission that is placed on the life of a believer. 

## Paul's Strategy for the Second Half

Paul, in those last few verses of that last chapter, he says, um, listen, uh, in the second half, he didn't actually say that, but a little bit of license, you know, in the second half. I want to give you a strategy. First of all, devote yourselves to prayer. Don't underestimate the power of prayer. I have seen Corps come absolutely alive because two or three influencers decided together to start praying for it. Don't underestimate the prayer he says. Pray, pray, pray. He says, be ready, be ready. He says, be careful when you're out there in the world amongst those who are yet to believe, those who have not yet come to faith. Be careful out there. Be sensitive. Be wise. Be clear. Be gracious. Be kind. But tell the story of God's love made available in the person of Jesus Christ. We are to be influencers Is in the world. 

He's marvelous. He's made himself known. He's rescued. He's redeemed. He's restored. He's taken up residence by his spirit. He reminds us that we are knowing that we are loved, that we have an eternal hope within us because of Jesus. He wants us to use his presence in our heart to keep us free, to keep us clean, to keep us holy, to keep us from being ineffective. He wants us to be conscious of his presence within our lives, to give us courage, to give us joy, to give us peace, to give us purpose, to make us holy. That he might use us as instruments within the community of believers. To love, to care, to encourage, to support, to pray, to worship, to heal in those ways, to practice our faith. And then he says, now go, go, go play the second half. Go play the second half on the planet. 

You imagine it. You imagine the Salvation Army around the world, everybody on Monday morning going, here we go, out we go. It's not about our organized programs. It's about me being who he wants me to be and who he needs to be to be today. Ready, available, willing, responsive, in tune with the spirit, ready to give a reason for the hope that is in me, and determined to demonstrate it. Because I'm an influencer for the Kingdom. 

I want the Salvation Army as a movement around the world to be this on fire group of influences for the Kingdom. It's been a great first half. We give thanks and praise and celebrate God for every victory won, for every kingdom extension that has taken place, for every new citizen that has been made through faith in Jesus Christ as a result of the mission and the ministry of the Salvation Army. But we are brave enough in these moments to say, Heavenly Father, we want the second half to be even more, even more in my life, in my corps, and on the planet. To which I say, count me in, count me in. 

## The Final Challenge

And so my final word to you this evening is this evening. This afternoon. Is a challenge. Really? Count me in. Can I count you into. Can I count you in? Are you in a in a your position? Are you in a position this morning? Are you in a position this morning? Like Paul wrote to those believers. Count me in. I understand who I am in Christ. I understand glory in the future. I understand that I have a purpose right now to be an influencer for the King and the kingdom, in my family, in my corps, and on the planet. Master, count me in. Amen. Amen. I'm done. The end. 

No no no no no no. Not not necessary. However, you know, we've got to find a way to wrap this up, right? We've got to finish this. So this is what I'm going to suggest. You've got. Hello. Whatever it is, just do it. That's nice. You know, there are times where, um. It's not really. You know, I haven't seen a half time coach in one of those rooms. Uh, you know, doing a now, if you're feeling inclined to go into the second half, you know, if you feel like you want to go out there and play the second half, well, you know, please come forward and indicate that you are ready to do the second half. Uh, it tends to be the coach that says something like, come on, team, let's go. Right. And that's what this moment is. This is one of those moments. It's like, are you in? Can I count on you? Can the king count on you? Are you in? Can you say count me in? 

Father, I understand the opportunity that's being presented to me in the second half. Count me in. If you are in that space this morning, I just want you to acknowledge that you're in this space. Come and stand down here with the rest of us and say, here I am. Count me in, I'm in. I'm in all the way. I'm not holding back. I'm not unreserved about it. Count me in. Right. So it's not, uh, it's it's it's not anything other than a decision that you're making in these moments. Count me in. I'm in. Look at you. Here you come. Come on. Come and stand down here. Run out of room for kneeling. Kneel on the concrete. Or just stand whatever you want to do. But this is. This is us saying to the King. We are ready for the second half. Whatever it's been is what it's been. But right now I'm stepping up to the plate to do the second half. You can count me in. An influencer for the kingdom, in my home, in my corps, in the world. I'm on point. An influencer for the King. Come on. 

Those of you who are coming down, just move further and further forward, and we'll make room for others because there are other people saying, yeah, man, I want to be a part of that. Count me in. This is us getting ready for the second half. Come on father. Look at us, King. Look at us. Look at us, father. See us right now. We're in your presence. We're putting up our hand and we're saying, count us in. Oh my goodness. You know what he did with twelve, right? You know what he did with twelve, right? Oh my goodness. What plans what plans has he got for this territory? Uh, you know, if he started with twelve, we got all this. Hello. Oh my goodness, father, this is beautiful. This is an act of holy worship right here. This is sacred right now. This is beautiful. 

I don't want to be on my own. Some of you might want to come up and stand up here. We're going to say a prayer in a minute, but let's make some room for some people and kind of find our way up. You can't, because there's somebody praying there, never mind squashing. Are there others? There's people standing at the back. You say, well, do I want to come and stand in the aisle? Why not stand in the aisle? Put your hand up. Do something to say yes, here I am. I'm in, I'm in, I'm in. Yes. Come on. Conference has been good for me. Hey, this has been a good half time break, right? But I'm now ready to do the second half for his glory, for his honor, for the extension of his kingdom. Count me in. I love it. I love it. Come on. It's beautiful. What a beautiful sight this is, right? Huh? This is for the king. This is us. This is us doing Romans twelve right now. Offering ourselves. I think, you know, if we were going to rewrite, if we were going to rewrite the scripture and we can't, we're not allowed to. But, yeah, offer yourselves as a living influencer for the king and for the kingdom. Here we are. 

## Closing Prayer

Shall we pray together? Can I pray with you? Yes, sir. Listen, this second half. This second half is going to be enormous. The Spirit of God is going to respond to this, we're going to have a great second half. Souls are going to be won. People are going to be born into the kingdom. Preachers are going to be raised up. Officers are going to be raised up. Right? Missionaries are going to be raised up. Disciples are going to be raised up. Our corps are going to pulsate with life. Ah, because we've determined in this House that we're going to influence it in for the king and for the kingdom. It's a beautiful thing. Here is. 

Father, let me pray with you. ABBA, father, look at us. You know us by name. You know our hearts. You know the sincerity with which we present ourselves to you today. I'm asking you, father. Come down. Come down amongst us, your people. Right. And touch us again with the beautiful, empowering presence of Your Holy Spirit. Bring us alive in these moments to the truths about you, the truths about us, and the need on the planet for your people to be on point. Help us Lord. We present ourselves to you as living sacrifices. We want to be used by you. We want to be used by you in our home, amongst our family. We want to be used by you amongst our corps. We want to be used by you amongst amongst our workplaces, our communities, the parts of the world that you've placed us in. No limits for you, father, because you have shown no limits to us. So I'm asking you in these moments, father, please sanctify these moments of worship. Set your seal upon the promises and the offerings that are being made in these moments, and use these beautiful instruments of yours to extend your kingdom's reach for your glory and for the salvation of the lost. And this is the prayer that we offer this morning in the beautiful, powerful, transforming name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. The Savior and Redeemer of the world and all God's people said, Amen. 

Wow. Now listen. Yes. If I'd thought about it, I'd have made certificates, you know, giving you some sort of diploma, saying you are now an influencer of the Salvation Army, Southern Territory. Uh, we haven't done that, but we've got it on our hearts. We belong to him. We are his. And that's a beautiful thing. May the Lord bless you and use you for his kingdom's sake. God bless you. Find your way back somewhere, I am sure, because I'm at the Salvation Army. There's going to be a closing song, there's going to be a celebration of some point, and we want to be a part of that. So may God bless you as you make yourself available to him. Amen. Count me in, coach. I'm ready. 

Hey, I thought as we go back to our seats, let's just say that I want to live right. That God can use me. I want to be an influencer. Let's do that. I want to live right. That God may use me at any time. I want to live. I use that. Word. Amen. Amen.
