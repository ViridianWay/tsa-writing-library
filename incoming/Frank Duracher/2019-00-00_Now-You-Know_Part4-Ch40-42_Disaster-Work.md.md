## CHAPTER 40
### Fishing Therapy

Captain Martha Higdon was mired in what she now calls "a funk" in the months following the devastation wrought to her beloved community of Port Arthur, Texas, by Hurricane Harvey.

The disaster has left behind dark psychological and emotional issues, as the town was nearly wiped away by saltwater from the nearby Gulf of Mexico. It has left scars on the people of Port Arthur, many of whom lost their homes and livelihoods. It has inflicted pain on the first-responders and disaster personnel who witnessed firsthand the horror of death and destruction.

Captain Martha was scarred by the storm. Fortunately, as a strong Christian woman, she found just the right therapy to help her cope with and even overcome her "funk." At the same time, her faith enabled her to continue aiding the people she'd grown to love while she and her husband, Frankco, served there as corps officers.

By her own account, Captain Martha was becoming an emotional wreck. The Higdons had to perform funerals for several of her Women's Ministries ladies who perished directly or indirectly because of the storm. The Port Arthur Corps building was deemed a total loss.

One year later, a daily average of 35 families continued to come to the Army's warehouse for food and clothing, and to resume with caseworkers the process of long-term recovery initiated by the Army.

Captain Martha had to find an outlet for her stress. Ironically, she found it in the very source of Port Arthur's tragedy—the water. She discovered fishing.

Due to the extent of her responsibilities, which were mostly disaster-related, Captain Martha found she could only get away for a few hours on most Saturdays. But that seemed to be enough. Saturdays were good for Martha, because her three daughters could go fishing with her.

"They have purple and pink fishing rods," she says, "and I bait their hooks and cast the line into the water. We've been catching croaker, sheepshead and black drum—and that's what we'd have for dinner that night!"

One wouldn't think that the waters from the gulf that caused so much heartache could also provide a source of healing. But Captain Martha's philosophy goes deeper.

"Waters cleanse and heal," she says with a knowing smile. "When I'm standing on that levee, and I throw my line out, I'm actually casting all my cares on Christ!"

A transfer to Paris, Texas as corps officers has taken the Higdons from their beloved community family in Port Arthur; but they are looking forward to loving their people in Lamar County.

Saltwater fishing is not an option in their new county, but there is plenty of freshwater fishing to be enjoyed.

And Captain Martha is ready. Her Mother's Day gift request prior to their move in 2018—freshwater fishing gear. Apparently, there's a difference.

Captain Martha's newfound release will continue to enable her to carry out her calling as a Salvation Army officer even better.

"After all," she concludes, "God called us to be fishers of men!"

You now know how Martha emerged from the depths following a disaster, because now you know even more of the Army's story.

## CHAPTER 41
### It's in the Book

Salvationists, you never knew Martin Henry Burg, Jr. But, oh my, he knew about you. He knew all about you. In fact, he knew you so well that he left to you most everything he had this side of Glory.

Granted, he did not know you for very long. He had no association with The Salvation Army at any time during his long life. There was never a corps in his hometown of LaPlace, Louisiana. So precious little evidence exists to indicate that he had even given much thought to The Salvation Army.

That is, he hadn't until just a few months before his death. Then he came to know you very well. How that happened—well, that's another otherwise obscure detail you are about to learn.

Martin had no heirs. He was a lifelong bachelor, and his mother preceded him in death. The bulk of his estate, which totaled about $3 million, was intended to be left to some organization that would put it to good use. What better legacy could Martin leave to this world than for his money to be the perpetual source of healing and aid to as many people as possible?

But which organization? And how would his money be used most efficiently?

By now, you've guessed that he chose our beloved Army. I should tell you at this point that the money he left to the Army comprised the lion's share of a four-story "Center of Hope" facility near downtown New Orleans. Over 250 people are accommodated daily through a network of Salvation Army programs, including a men's and women's Harbor Light, transitional housing for families and community social services.

Martin's gift became a stimulus for several other major donations which made the building possible. The City of New Orleans contributed $1 million from Community Development Block Grant funds, and the Freeport-McMoRan Foundation provided $500,000.

Commissioners Kenneth & Joann Hodder (USA Southern Territorial leaders at the time) dedicated the facility to the glory of God in March 1997. Since that grand dedication, men, women and children have been receiving sorely-needed shelter, counseling and meals while they get back on their feet.

Fast forward to 2005, when over 300 homeless were marooned on the fourth floor of the Center of Hope, trying to escape the rising floodwaters brought by Hurricane Katrina. Even patients from a nearby hospital sought safety.

Majors Richard & Faye Brittle were the New Orleans area commanders during that infamous event, and the Brittles were lauded for saving the lives of the 300+ souls under their ministry. Food began to diminish, and things got so bad that Major Richard had to start rationing what was left.

Upon hearing about the dire situation, President George W. Bush ordered National Guard helicopters to move that quadrant up in priority, and all inside were soon saved from the building's rooftop—making national news.

None of this would have been possible if Martin had not done his homework back in the 1990s. Being a meticulous man who did not want to leave his estate to just anyone, he decided to do some research. He found a book of charities, and he read it from cover to cover. Many he read about were worthy, as they did good work. But when he read about The Salvation Army, something clicked.

A few more books and articles specifically about the Army told him more about our movement. He read our Mission Statement, and he learned about our religious and charitable ministries and our history. He learned that The Salvation Army has been America's favorite charity each year for some time, and by that time, he knew why.

He had read enough. He liked what he saw in us. And he put the books on the returned-books counter.

That's right—the spot where Martin Henry Burg, Jr. met The Salvation Army, the only place where he could learn of us through impartial facts and figures, and the only source he knew to guide him concerning a legacy he wanted to leave mankind—was LaPlace's public library!

Thousands—including 300+ huddled on the top floor to escape Hurricane Katrina—have been the recipients of Martin's charity during these past 20 years of the Center of Hope's operation. And the work continues.

## CHAPTER 42
### Pay It Backward

Minerva Torres is already getting ready for Christmas. And if The Salvation Army's Christmas effort following the onslaught of Hurricane Maria on her native Puerto Rico is any indication, each Yuletide will present blossoming opportunities for ministry and service.

Minerva firmly believes that her present role as Social Ministries Director for the Puerto Rico & Virgin Islands Division (PRVID) "fits like a glove." She also believes that nothing happens by accident; God's plan for the people is to realize that the Army is here for them during long-term recovery.

Ironically, Minerva's intersection with her calling to spend her life helping others dates to a much earlier connection to The Salvation Army some 1,600 miles away.

"I grew up here in Puerto Rico," Minerva explains, "but my mother was the victim of domestic violence, so she brought us to the Bronx in New York to start a new life."

That's where Minerva and her family were first helped by The Salvation Army.

"When we arrived in the States, we only had one suitcase of clothes for all of us. The Salvation Army provided us with nice clothes that we could proudly wear to school. That was a really big deal for us!"

The Salvation Army did even more.

"The corps offered us a safe place. My mother still marvels at how much the Army means to us."

Minerva's family moved to Rochester, New York, and there, as well, the Army was a place of refuge and regeneration.

"We attended worship at the corps in both the Bronx and later in Rochester."

Years later, it was safe for her mother, now retired, to return to her native Puerto Rico to live. By that time, Minerva was working on her advanced education that would prepare her for the monumental task facing her in the post-Maria PRVID.

She earned her associate degree at St. Petersburg College. Later, she enrolled at the Universidad Interamericana in Puerto Rico, where she received her bachelor's degree and a Master of Social Work degree in Administration. She is currently completing a Doctorate in Organizational Leadership through Nova Southeastern University.

"It's funny to look back on my life and see how God guided me to where I am now," Minerva marvels. "The Army was so influential to my family in New York, and now, I want to help other families with that kind of helping hand. I want children to find a great life, like me, and perhaps they will grow up to serve others as well!"

"The Magic of Christmas" is a division-wide effort that caught on like wildfire in December 2017. Designed to "bring the magic back," the effort has provided thousands of families with immediate assistance after Hurricane Maria. They will continue to feel blessed by the Army's loving efforts each year at Christmas time.

"We were already serving thousands of families each December in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, but the contacts we established after Maria pushed our totals last year to almost double that of 2016," she says.

Her message to families when she is in the field is, "The Salvation Army feeds your heart and feeds your soul. This is what we do!"

Minerva doesn't seem overwhelmed when talking about a long-term disaster recovery effort that can take another three years to complete—and oh yes, there's an upcoming Christmas season, too.

"My role is to work as a team member. I feel that everything we do here must be on a united front. Our mission is already waiting for us. God is guiding us. We only have to keep our focus on Him, and the people we're serving!"

**Historical Context Note:** This fourth section, "Now You Know: The Army's Disaster Work," highlights The Salvation Army's vital role in emergency response and disaster relief through three compelling contemporary stories. These accounts demonstrate how the Army's disaster services extend far beyond immediate relief—encompassing long-term recovery, emotional healing, and the transformation of tragedy into hope. From Captain Martha Higdon's therapeutic fishing following Hurricane Harvey, to Martin Henry Burg Jr.'s transformative legacy that helped hurricane victims years later, to Minerva Torres's full-circle journey from hurricane refugee to disaster relief coordinator, these stories illustrate the Army's comprehensive approach to disaster ministry. They reveal how the Army not only responds to immediate physical needs but also addresses the deeper spiritual and emotional wounds that disasters create, often discovering that those who were once helped become the helpers, creating an endless cycle of compassion and service that spans generations and geography.
