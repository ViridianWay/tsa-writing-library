# How to Preach Part Four

_From "The Officer, No. 8, August, 1893. Vol. 1" by William Booth_

---

Now, I am writing these papers in such a scrappy manner that they must of necessity be more or less disconnected. You who read them must please remember this. If I can only say what is in my mind, and that in a sufficiently intelligible manner to be understood, I shall be content.

Still, I must endeavor to go forward in something like order; but before I get again on to the track, I want to have another word bearing upon the question of preparation for the platform, of which I have already spoken. There was one thing that occurred to my mind when I wrote, and to which, although I then attached considerable importance, still I did not think it of sufficient weight to speak, but on reflection I feel constrained to mention it.

Go to the platform in as good a physical condition as you can. The close connection existing between the state of the body and the mind is well known. Good spirits are a wonderful qualification for freedom and effectiveness in speaking, while a languid condition of body, or a stomach out of order, are uncompromising enemies of good spirits as they are indeed of almost every other grace.

Now, while health and physical vigor are not at our command, I know that it is possible to do much in that direction. See how the athletes train themselves. How careful they are in what they eat and drink; in exercising themselves, and in the amount of sleep they take, striving by all means within their power to come up to their work in what they call "good condition."

## THE CONNECTION BETWEEN EATING AND TALKING.

I might illustrate here with my own experience. I have to take all manner of care to keep myself equal to my work. I have to guard my appetites and rigidly refuse even the slightest indulgences that would be likely to disorder my stomach or depress my nervous powers. Nay, as a rule, I find that anything else like a full or satisfying meal immediately before I speak, hinders my ease and comfort in speaking. My experience may be no criterion on which to guide others, but I give it for what it is worth, and I have heard other speakers of prominence say substantially the same. Every man who wants to get the greatest amount of work out of his body, brain, and heart, for the sake of the Kingdom of God and the salvation of souls, will have to study himself and act with care. I am sure you will bear with me in saying here that I fear that much time is lost on the sick list, and that many nervous prostrations and breakdowns, and, if I am not mistaken, many early graves are the result of ill-management in eating and drinking, and in the management of the body generally.

Perhaps some officers will say that there is no call for this caution in their case – that small salaries, or no salary at all, effectually prevent the indulgence in those luxuries which are likely to interfere with health. To them I reply, that many of those helps to appetite in which our poorer officers only too commonly indulge are quite as injurious as any of the luxuries referred to. The inordinate use of pickles, canned meat, tea and coffee morning, noon, and night, heavy suppers, and other indulgences, if they don't breed actual disease, are the uncompromising enemies of a clear head and a warm heart, and their use will only too often result in dull, spiritless addresses and heartless platform work generally.

Now, let me come to something like the train of ideas I was following up in my last paper. I was writing when I closed, upon the importance of speaking straight to the people who were there before you, and I want now to say something on the importance of –

## NO FOOLERY ON THE PLATFORM.

A becoming gravity on the platform. No one who knows me will suppose for a moment that I have any partiality to anything like a melancholy or sanctimonious manner in a speaker, whether on the platform, in the open-air, or anywhere else. A hard, cold, funereal style, or anything approaching to it, will of itself be sufficient to close the ears and hearts of the people against you, while a warm, friendly manner of address is indispensable if you are to be listened to by the crowds whom you want to interest, benefit, and save.

At the same time I want to say that I am equally opposed to anything after the fun-making style, and therefore warn every officer who reads this against being led away into the habit of joking or retailing jests, the saying of silly and ridiculous things, simply for the purpose of making people laugh or amusing them for the moment.

If you were a clown in a circus ring, put there on purpose to amuse an audience, it would be quite a different thing; your hearers would have come on purpose to be amused, and have paid for it, and you would be a buffoon paid to furnish them with the article. But your cause, I need not say, is altogether different. The men and women before you are rebels against God, on the verge of hell; Mercy is offered them. They are indifferent to the offer. You are sent of God, or profess to be, to impress them with their danger and to persuade them to accept the offered grace and flee from the wrath to come.

On the other hand, your hearers will be the children of God, pressed down by the troubles of life, perplexed with its difficulties, endangered by its temptations, or depressed and discouraged by ten thousand things that are calculated to lessen their zeal in the great war against evil. In which case your calling from God and man, from earth and heaven, evidently is to seriously and earnestly help them as they need to the uttermost of your ability.

Now, officers should try to note the difference between what is simply natural or humorous, and what is jocose or laughable. I fancy that mistakes are frequently made because this distinction is not observed. Character may be described so exactly and so naturally by a speaker that it is impossible to avoid smiling on the part of the hearers; or the truth, the plainest truth, the most cutting truth, may be put before people in such a pleasant and simple manner that it amuses them while it convicts and condemns them at every turn. The pleasant manner only acts as a feather which carries the arrow more surely and deeply to the heart.

But all this is quite a different thing to officers saying funny or silly things just to make people laugh, or to create an agreeable sensation for the moment. That I am compelled utterly to condemn – nay, I go further, and say that no officer should be tempted to raise any merry and hilarious spirit in any audience without being able to immediately follow it up with some corresponding weighty truth. Before the smile has died away from the countenance the Sword of the Spirit should be plunged into the heart. For, under no circumstances, can there be any reasonable excuse for the saying or doing anything while engaged in so serious a business, and speaking on so solemn and important a subject, which does not contain some useful lesson, or prepare the way for some divinely-inspired truth.

I should think, if there is one sight which above another excites the deepest abhorrence of the angels, as they flit about this world on their errands of mercy, it is to see a man or woman doing the buffoon in the pulpit or on the platform while professing to represent the suffering, agonizing Christ, whose whole life was a sorrow, and whose death filled heaven with silence and awe. When you are tempted, as tempted you will be, to jest simply to gain the smiles of your audience, remember Him and His history, and forbear!

Brother, sister, settle it for ever in your soul that to be effective it is essential that those who hear you should feel that you are in dead earnest, that you are sent of God, and talking for eternity; and never forget that jesting or silly talking will utterly prevent the formation of such a conviction, or effectually destroy it if it is already there.

## MAKE YOURSELF EASILY HEARD.

My next point is, Speak up. Make everybody hear you, and that if you can without any effort to themselves. When you stand up to speak, always remember that your business is to convey some particular ideas to the minds and hearts of the people before you, with a view to their being influenced thereby. But what you say will be of no service unless it can be heard, and that readily. Many who will be at the trouble to come to your Barracks will not be at much trouble either to hear or understand what you have to say when they are there unless they can do it with ease. To this end stand with your head well up, and pitch your voice so that you feel yourself that those in the further seats can hear you.

Don't speak louder than is necessary for this. To do so will neither make it pleasanter for them to listen, nor easier for you to speak. Any amount of voice more than is necessary to be heard means, on your part, just that much strength thrown away. Moreover, if you shout all the way through your address, you cannot raise your voice without some unpleasant shriek or scream when you come to the more important parts of it which you will want to emphasize.

Some speakers fall into an objectionable habit of commencing their addresses in a low, muttering key, and rise as they warm to their subject, as they call it. They may be a necessity for them, and very agreeable to those on the front seats who can hear what they say; but it appears to me to be very unfair to those further down the building or to those in the gallery who cannot hear them, and who have consequently to wait for the "warming-up process" before they know what is really going on. Avoid this custom, which is a horrid one in my estimation. Stand up at the onset and make yourself heard by every one in the building.

## TO DO GOOD YOU MUST BE UNDERSTOOD.

Make yourself understood when you are heard. As you cannot benefit your hearers by anything you say unless they hear your words, even so your words will be of no service unless your hearers know their meaning, or grasp the ideas that you intend to convey by them.

That applies to your language. Avoid the use of hard words even if they are natural to you, much more don't try to find them. Because, in the first place, the people who do understand your fine language won't think you any the cleverer for it, but just the contrary; and those who don't understand it will be effectually hindered from gaining any benefit by what you say. Hard words and ponderous high-flown sentences are directly opposed to effective speaking. The most powerful orators the world has ever known have used the simplest language. In modern times I may instance John Bright in the political, and Charles Spurgeon in the religious world. Both these men, each standing at the head of his order, so far as Great Britain is concerned, seldom used words that were above the comprehension of the most ordinary individual in their meetings.

For myself, I purposely select the simplest language that I can possibly command, never knowingly using a word that appears above the apprehension of the youngest and most illiterate of my audience, and when by any means such a word does slip from my tongue I invariably follow it in explanation with one that can be readily understood.

Many people don't understand hard words because they have never had the privilege of education; and many who have spent years in the ordinary public schools, are perfectly ignorant of the meaning of many of the words that are in use around them every day. Then many of your hearers have never been to school at all, and you are bound by the mere feeling of benevolence to use such language as they can readily apprehend. What possible profit can there be to these poor creatures if you don't?

## DRAWING AN INFERENCE.

A story comes to my memory in illustration of this that I remember hearing when a boy. A certain clergyman had been preaching an occasional sermon at the church of a friend where the audience was largely made up of working people. When the company sat down after the service to dinner at the Vicarage, something was said about the sermon, and the vicar suggested to his visitor that he was afraid that it was very much over the heads of the congregation. The strange clergyman was very much surprised, and said he thought he had been very simple, and asked if any words could be named that he had employed which could not be readily understood. "Well," said the vicar, "you talked about 'drawing an inference,' and I fancy there were a good many in the church this morning who would not know what that meant." The stranger was surprised; said he could not believe it. To test the matter it was agreed that the vicar should call in his carter and ascertain whether he understood the meaning of the phrase.

Accordingly the carter came in, and the vicar said, "Well, John; I want to ask you a question." "Right, sir!" "Do you think, John," the vicar went on, "that you could draw an inference?" Whereupon John scratched his head, thought for a time, and then replied, "Well, sir, I guess that our grey mare could draw anything that the traces would hold." The company smiled, John retired, and the strange parson was convinced that he had been using language which his audience could not comprehend. Mind you don't go over the heads of the poor people whose salvation or damnation depends on your making matters plain to them, by using words they cannot understand.

## NOT SAYING THINGS IN AN OUTLANDISH MANNER.

Don't labor to say things upon your subject that have never been said before, or to say them in some unusual manner. Your business is not to make an exhibition of fireworks by using such curious language, or sounding sentences that have never been listened to by your hearers, thereby exciting their wonder and admiration of your ability, but to distribute the bread of life, and to persuade the perishing people to eat of it. Or, varying the figure, you are not sent by God to gain the admiration of the people who are dying all around of the hell-plague of sin, but to persuade them to gaze upon the Crucified and be healed.

Be simple and understandable in your ideas. The Way of Salvation, and everything that has to do with walking in it, and with all the deep and experimental blessedness to which it leads, both in this life and in the next, is so simple that a fool, though a wayfaring man, can understand it if placed before him in a simple, straightforward and understandable manner.

Now, I don't know how to be sufficiently emphatic here. In talking about Preparation I have to some extent gone over this ground, but I must recur to it again. To be successful you must be understood. I am quite sure that we are always falling into the mistake of supposing that our hearers know more about the things concerning the Kingdom of God than they do. Nothing is much more puzzling to me than the ignorance of people who have been hearing salvation preaching for a lifetime, respecting the simplest questions connected with religion. They are as dark in many places as the very heathen concerning the meaning for Forgiveness, and Faith, and Holiness, and the Love of Christ, and the Evils of Sin, the Joys of Heaven and the Pains of Hell. How much more ignorant must those multitudes be who have had scarcely any teaching at all on these subjects!

Then it must be remembered that it is not merely Intellectual Ignorance that we have to fight, it is the Natural Darkness and Pollution of the Human Heart, and the devices, excuses and misrepresentations which the devil only too often whispers into one ear while we in the name of Jesus Christ are speaking to the other; for Satan fights with us for the souls of men at every turn.

We must therefore set ourselves, when we stand up to talk to the people, to be as simple as simplicity itself. We must understand what we want to say ourselves, and then say it in the plainest possible language and make ourselves understood if necessary by going over and over again with it.

In talking to an audience you should carefully watch the countenances of our hearers. You can readily gather from their faces whether they understand you or not, and if you feel they don't you must try again, for, whatever happens,

**YOU MUST BE UNDERSTOOD.**

This concluding installment of Booth's "How to Preach" series completes his comprehensive training manual for Salvation Army officers. Written for "The Officer" magazine in August 1893, this final part emphasizes the practical and physical aspects of effective preaching. Booth's attention to physical preparation demonstrates his holistic understanding of ministry, while his firm stance against "foolery on the platform" reflects his conviction that the gospel message demands reverence and earnestness. His emphasis on clear, simple communication, illustrated by the memorable anecdote about "drawing an inference," encapsulates his commitment to reaching all people, regardless of education or social status. The series concludes with Booth's fundamental principle that effective preaching must above all be understood by its hearers – a timeless truth that remains as relevant today as it was in Victorian London.
